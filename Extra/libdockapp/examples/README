About the examples
------------------
In this directory you find the example applications for libDockApp. This is a
work in progress. It is not easy to come up with good examples of how to use
features without bloating it with "stuff you don't need to know". That's why it
is far from finished, and that's also why I INVITE YOU TO SUBMIT simple dockapps
that provide good examples of certain features.

The examples:
------------
   basic:
	This is an example that uses a few simple shapes; a rectangle containing
	a bouncing ball.
	It shows how to use the abstracted DAShapedPixmap structs and how to use
	X Window types for overlaying one shape on top of another (something
	much easier and more flexible than trying to blend the pixmaps
	together).
	It also shows some simple event handling (a timeout event and a window
	close event).

    rectangles:
	This example shows how to use "action rectangles". Those are areas that
	you define callbacks for events on.
	The example got rather mixed up with X drawing calls, and creating
	shapes by hand from X regions. I'm thinking about either stripping it of
	most functionality to make it a proper example of what it tries to show,
	or to rename it to "tangles".
	It even uses some deprecated features...

    shapes:
	NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
	And maybe a tad superfluous, as "basic" already show how to use shapes.

Needed examples:
---------------
I need examples that show one or more of the following (less is better):
- Something very basic; just showing how to get started.
- Command line parameter parsing.
- Action rectangles; my example isn't very good.
- How to handle different icon sizes flexibly (I think that could result in some
  new library functions to be added).
- Loading pixmaps in runtime.
