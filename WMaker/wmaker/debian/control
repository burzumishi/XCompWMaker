Description: NeXTSTEP-like window manager for X
 Written by Alfredo Kojima almost from scratch, resembles the NeXTStep look
 very closely, and it is now an official GNU project. Window Maker (originally
 named WindowMaker) is not overloaded with features, and it is easier to
 configure than most other window managers. Its final goal is to produce a
 window manager that doesn't require editing of configuration files.
 Window Maker is fast and doesn't require tons of memory to run.

Description: Window Maker's own widget set
 WINGs Is Not GNUstep (WINGs) is a small widget set with the NeXTSTEP
 look and feel. Its API is inspired in OpenSTEP and its
 implementation borrows some ideas from Tk. It has a reasonable set of
 widgets, sufficient for building small applications like a CDPlayer
 or hacking something like rxvt. It is used for basic widgets in
 the WindowMaker window manager.
