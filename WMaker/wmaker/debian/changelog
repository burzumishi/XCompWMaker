      field. (Lintian description-contains-homepage)

  * New upstream generates dynamic libraries of libWUtils and libWINGs, ship
    them in two new binary packages. Make libwings-dev depend on them.

  * wrlib/xpm.c::RGetImageFromXPMData: handles all the defined xpm color
    specification formats. (sent upstream) (closes: bug#35502)
  * Splitted wmaker into wmaker and wmaker-plain.  wmaker depends on
    each of wmaker-{plain,gnome,kde}; each of them depends on wmaker (=
    ${Source-Version}).  This ensures upgrades will be performed
    smoothly.
  * debian/wmaker-gnome.prerm: s/debian/gnome/
  * debian/wmaker.postinst.tmpl: removes WindowMaker-debian alternative
    upon installation.
  * debian/wmaker.prerm: removed code to remove alternative.
  * debian/wmaker-{gnome,kde}.menu: removed.  Those are confusing people.
  * debian/control: modified wmaker's description.  (s/afterstep//gi)
  * debian/wmaker.menu: fixed sort keys for several entries

wmaker (0.60.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debina/rules::build-wmaker-debian-stamp: removes leftovers that
    shouldn't be in the tarball in the first place.  Since I'm using a
    VPATH build, make in checking in $(builddir)/WindowMaker/Defaults for
    WMWindowAttributes, WindowMaker and WMState, and _also_ in
    $(srcdir)/WindowMaker/Defaults.  Since it finds that the $(srcdir)
    versions are newer than their `.in' dependencies, it doesn't
    regenerate the files in $(builddir), which is _bad_ because
    WindowMaker/IconSets/Makefile.am searches for WMWindowAttributes in
    ../Defaults (or something equivalent to that). (closes: bug#38572)

    Restart commands.  Added Info Panel and Legal Panel.  (closes:

  * New upstream release
  * Oops... this is going to be problematic.  I stupidly `corrected'
    libwraster's libtool version on the last release.  That produced
    libwraster2.  But upstream didn't made this change.  Now the libtool
    version has been correctly changed wrt 0.53.0, but my fix wasn't
    incorporated.  That means libtool version is now 3:0:2, instead of
    3:0:1.  That produces libwraster1, not libwraster2.  This is
    technically wrong, but I'll stick to upstream's version.  Guy's gonna
    kill me... I submitted a bug asking for the removal of libwraster1
    from the archive.  Now I'll have to ask for the removal of libwraster2
    and have libwraster1 reincorporated into the archive.
  * debian/control: went back to libwraster1.
  * debian/wmaker.menu-method: added SHORTCUT support. (Thanks blue!)
  * debian/README: updated to reflect SHORTCUT support.
  * debian/rules: yet another try at shlibs info.  This time I have
    finally got this right.

    README.KDE between 0.52.0 and 0.53.0 it seems --enable-lite is not
    such a good idea afterall.
  * debian/wmaker.postinst.tml: try to cope with a dangling symlink in the
    alternatives.
  * debian/wmaker-{gnome,kde}.prerm: added.  Reread packaging manual.
    Alternatives are removed on prerm, NOT postrm. (closes: bug#34526,

wmaker (0.52.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: changed dependency of libwraster to (>= 0.52.0)
  * debian/wmaker-gnome.menu: menu entries specific to
    wmaker-gnome. (thanks squirk!) (closes: bug#35148)
  * debian/wmaker-kde.menu: menu entries especific to wmaker-kde.
  * debian/wmaker.menu: added entry for "Debian" wmaker.
  * debian/WMWindowAttributes: added gnome stuff. (thanks Crow!) (closes:
    bug#34557)
  * debian/README.Debian: Updated.
  * debian/wmaker: no longer creates ~/GNUstep/.AppInfo, wmaker itself
    will create the directory if needed.
  * deban/wmakerpl.menu-method: new file, experimental.  It works, but I'm
    not really sure what I should do with it.  Right now it builds
    /etc/X11/WindowMaker/plmenu.hook, but nothing else uses it.  I was
    thinking about changing WPrefs.app to use it for it's ``template''
    file but I'm not convinced that's a good idea.
  * debian/rules: new target to create debian/shlibs.local -- I keep
    forgetting to edit the file.  The version information is now located
    at the top of debian/rules.  clean target removes debian/shlibs.local
  * Still pondering splitting wmaker into wmaker and wmaker-debian.
    wmaker-debian, wmaker-gnome and wmaker-kde would provide
    `wmaker-binary' (better name anyone?) and wmaker would depend on
    that.  This would make wmaker ~ 220 kB smaller.
  * debian/rules::install-wmaker-debian-stamp: Speaking of smaller, nuked
    /usr/lib/GNUstep/Apps/WPrefs.app/xpm.  WTH do I want that for if I
    have WPrefs.app/tiff _and_ tiff support is compiled in?
  * debian/rules::install-wmaker-debian-stamp: nuked .xpm counterparts of
    .tiff icons.  There are _too_ many of them and it's pure bloat.

  * Icons copyright situation cleared: wmaker is GPL.  The libraries are
    LGPL.  The icons are OPL.
  * wrlib/Makefile.am: changed version info to 2:0:0, interface is
    different!
  * debian/rules: README.GNOME installed in wmaker-gnome
  * debian/rules: README.KDE installed in wmaker-kde
  * debian/rules: wkdemenu.pl installed in wmaker-kde
  * src/*.c, WINGs/*.c, WPrefs/*.c: global defaults are installed in

    bogus dependencies between these files.  I think I can say I got them

    (closes: bug#32905)
  * debian/control: added wmaker-kde.  Wait! Don't jump on me just yet!
    If this can make your soul rest easier, think of wmaker-kde as a
    window manager that implements a funky communications protocol.
  * debian/rules: changed a lot of stuff to handle the new package in a
    sane way.
  * WindowMaker/Defaults/Makefile.am: removed dependency of some files on
    ./Makfile (what the heck is that for?) (sent upstream)

  * New upstream version
  * Removed many patches, most are incorporated upstream. With some others
    it's obvious they won't be incorporated and it doesn't make sense to
    keep pushing them in the Debian diff's (they are mostly cosmetic
    things related to how things are built)
  * debian/rules: removes wrlib/get-wraster-flags on clean
  * debian/control: removed libwmaker0 package; only a static library is
    built now.
  * src/main.c: fixed message for unknown options; actually prints help if
    requested
  * doc/wmaker.1x: updated to reflect new option syntax.
  * debian/manpages/wmaker.1x: ditto.
  * doc/*: updated manpages.
  * debian/rules: After looking at what exactly does --enable-kanji do, it
    is obvious that the MB patch is not up to date with the rest of the
    code; this means I'm removing --enable-kanji from the configure
    options until someone fixes and TESTS it with iso-8859-1 characteres.
    I can't do it because I understand zip about the way MB works.  I
    _think_ the problem is in the lenght of the string and/or the way it's
    encoded, but I'm problably wrong.

    this: "corrupted tarball" or something like that.

    from asclock).  The approach taken: save the `good' file, remove the
    diversion, put the `good' file back in place.  How do I know which one
    the good file is?  Simple: asclock conflicts with wmaker << 0.15.0 and
    afterstep <= 1.4-6; wmaker >= 0.15.0 didn't provide any of the
    diverted files, so if there's a diversion and there's no original
    file, the diversion is the `good' file.  If the diversion and the
    original file are there, the `good' file is the original file. (Thanks

    `slapic') (closes: bug#31419, bug#32649)

  * debian/wmaker.preinst: how the heck did it work on the machines I
    tested this, I have no idea.  Adam Di Carlo provided enough
    information regarding this bug and I was able to reproduce the
    scenario where it triggers.  Thanks Adam! (closes: bug#31419)

wmaker (0.20.3-3) frozen; urgency=low

  * debian/wmaker.preinst: Arrrggghhh! I forgot to move the fix for
    bug#31419 from 0.50.2-0.0.4 into 0.20.3-2!!! I had installed a fixed
    version of 0.50.2-0.0.4 on my development machine and, of course, the
    diversion wasn't there anymore, so when I installed 0.20.3-2 on the
    same machine I didn't notice the fix wasn't there...  I need another
    slink machine!!! (Hmmm... there's a victim at the other end of the
    room) (closes: bug#31419)
  * debian/control: Changed 'Recommends: wmaker-usersguide' to 'Suggests:
    wmaker-userguide'.  First, someone files a bug because there's no
    documentation, and now someone doesn't like the fact that there's
    documentation.  I don't understand you people...
  * debian/wmaker.postrm: fixed horrendous bug in abort-upgrade.  This has
    been there for ages... funny how people catch more bugs during deep
    freeze stages. (closes: bug#32320)

  * debian/control: added 'Recommends: wmaker-usersguide' (closes:

  * po/Makefile.am: fixed $(DESTDIR) (closes... no, the bug isn't on the
    BTS, it was mailed to me directly)
  * WPrefs.app/po/Makefile.am: ditto.
  * debian/wmaker.menu-method: added escapes for '*' (closes: bug#30622,

  * debian/wmaker.preinst: fixed old diversion removal (closes: bug#31419)

  * New upstream version. Incorporates all the upstream patches in
    0.20.2-1, 0.20.2-2 and 0.20.2-3. (Makes the diff.gz *much* smaller)
    and fixes some more bugs.
  * Fixes problems with SSH (namely bug#29505) (closes: bug#29505)
  * Also fixes problems with SSH over networks (closes: bug#30026)
  * Upstream removed some ${SHELL} hacks. (closes: bug#29658, bug#30298)
  * Fixes "migrating xv windows" (closes: bug#30381)
  * WindowMaker/appearance.menu, WindowMaker/background.menu: copied from
    my local /etc/X11/WindowMaker/ files; those are the files are menu
    generates them which is a good thing in case some is not running menu.

wmaker (0.20.2-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied more upstream patches: grayscale and 8bit jpeg support; fixed
    client restoration in restart/exit in multiheads; fixed problem with
    docked programs that have names with spaces; updated WPrefs.app for
    iconificationstyle; added -static command line option; put redundant
    NoWindowOverDock; fixed overlapping clip icon bug; extended window
    level code; added KeepOnBottom hint; added iconification style to
    WPrefs.app; fixed crash with bad value in defaults file; changed icon
    stacking code; added primitive support for 5 button mouse (for
    switching workspaces); fixed BadAccess and crash on programs that do
    XGrabButton; fixed bug with rootmenu Exec not working when stty is
    called from ~/.tcshrc; fixed bug with Move menu and sloppy focus;
    temporarily removed SHELL support in apps menu.
  * Someone pointed out that due to a patch applied in 0.20.2-2, Window
    Maker thinks its version is "0.20.3" instead of "0.20.2". Since
    there's no 0.20.3 upstream source yet, I guess we can live with that.

wmaker (0.20.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with new X packages (release -7 specifically)
  * New X packages ship X locales with xlib6g (closes: bug#28967)
  * Applied upstream patches that fixes several bugs. Cut-and-paste from
    the updated changelog: fixed bug in miniaturizing atribute panel,
    fixed bug for 64bit machines, fixed bug for apps that put strings with
    "." in WM_CLASS, added handling for reparented client windows, fixed
    bug with window positioning (this one is bug#24770 I think -- I need
    confirmation from the submitter), fixed cascade window placement to
    account for dock, fixed bug in window positioning by clients, fixed
    problem with random window placement.
  * configure.in: reverted patch to --with-appspath. debian/rules:
    modified to reflect this (closes: bug#28620, bug#28627, bug#28632,
    bug#28865)
  * debian/rules: dockit is gone but manpage is still installed
  * debian/wmaker.postinst.tmpl: removed the code to add Window Maker to
    /etc/X11/window-managers and replaced with register-window-manager
    (the interface provided by the xbase package). This fixes #28841
    partially (that's two bugs in one, this is the not-so-important part)
  * debian/wmaker.postrm: ditto for removal from /etc/X11/window-managers
  * On my system bug #26682 doesn't show up with this build and the new
    set of X pacakges. I'm not closing it because I've seen this come and
    go rather randomly.
  * Release 0.20.1-2 fixed bug #27411, I should have noted this on the
    changelog (I actually did but I never mentioned the bug number). It
    also fixed bug #27433.
  * WindowMaker/wmmacros: added macros for LOCAL_THEMES_DIR,
    LOCAL_STYLES_DIR, LOCAL_ICON_SETS_DIR, LOCAL_SOUND_SETS_DIR,
    LOCAL_BACKGROUNDS_DIR, USER_THEMES_DIR, USER_STYLES_DIR,
    USER_ICON_SETS_DIR, USER_SOUND_SETS_DIR, USER_BACKGROUNDS_DIR
  * WindowMaker/appearance.menu, WindowMaker/background.menu: added
    LOCAL_* paths and changed ~/GNUstep/... to USER_* (closes: bug#29473)
  * wrlib/Makefile.am: oops. Actually change shared version to
    1:0:0... hmmm... no wonder this made so much trouble.
  * debian/rules: fixed call to dh_shlibdeps... wrong dependencies were
    computed!

wmaker (0.20.2-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, fixes quite a few bugs, outstanding: timer bug
    (it is not possible to leave Window Maker <= 0.20.1 running for more
    than approx 28 days), the Emacs crash bug (fixed in previous Debian
    releases), focus bugs, crash bug with transient windows (The Gimp,
    etc), fixed crash bug with bad mgradients, better dithering in 8bpp.
  * Modified default IconPath and PixmapPath to more sensible values
    (/usr/local/<stuff> added)
  * WindowMaker/Defaults/WindowMaker.in: IconPath and PixmapPath changed
  * WPrefs.app/Paths.c: modified default values for IconPath and
    PixmapPath
  * src/wconfig.h.in: modified default values for IconPath and PixmapPath
  * debian/README.Debian: modified IconPath and PixmapPath
  * Upstream incorporated patch from 0.20.1-2 (Re: aspect ratio)
  * debian/README.Debian: fixed some grammar mistakes.
  * debian/control: fixed description per user's request.
  * Redid libtool patch. Sent upstream again. Maybe this time they'll take
    it as it seems Alfredo and/or Dan have begun putting shared library
    support in configure.in (sent upstream)
  * configure.in: modified handling of libPropList. It seems Alfredo
    and/or Dan are trying to get this thing to be foolproof, but in the
    process they are making it very difficult to get wmaker to build for
    ppl who happen to read the docs... :-(
  * WINGs/wapplication.c: modified to use --with-appspath from
    configure (sent upstream)
  * debian/rules: I give up! Forget about telling WindowMaker its Defaults
    directory lives in /etc/GNUstep. Use the darned symlink. Removed all
    the patches that made this work... I'm sick of reapplying those.
  * debian/*: s/WindowMaker/Window Maker/ in several places.
  * debian/rules: moves wm-oldmenu2new to /usr/doc/wmaker; the script it's
    a hack. It works but YMMV.
  * WINGs/wevent.c: added patch from Pascal Hofstee
    <daeron@Wit401305.student.utwente.nl>. Fixes a bug with select
    complaining about an invalid argument.
  * Added several entries for The Gimp, which make it look lots nicer
    and more usable under WindowMaker.

  * debian/control: changed all Recommends to Suggests
  * src/defaults.c: moved a pice of code to put the background color on
    the root window before the background image...
  * debian/README.Debian: added a note about WPrefs segfaulting with the
    nice looking menu button. READ IT, it's at the end.
  * debian/wmaker: I wrote wmaker.1x yet it seems I didn't read
    it... GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT holds the full path to the root directory for
    the user, NOT the directory name under ${HOME}.
  * debian/wmaker: copies WMRootMenu. This is an ugly-freeze-is-tomorrow
    fix.

wmaker (0.20.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Squashed bug Re: incorrect filenames in Themes.

  * debian/patch.wmaker: fixed things a bit to get INCLUDES = -D_REENTRANT
    for libraries.
  * configure.in: removed test for X_LOCALE
  * WINGs/wapplication.c: changed /usr/local/share/GNUstep to
    /usr/local/lib/GNUstep to get it in sync with the rest of the paths.
  * po/Makefile.am: added $(DESTDIR)/ in front of @NLSDIR@ to get it to
    install properly. Added WindowMaker.pot to CLEAN_FILES.
  * WPrefs/po/Makefile.am: added $(DESTDIR)/ in front of @NLSDIR@ to get
    it to install properly. Added WPrefs.pot to CLEAN_FILES.

wmaker (0.20.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Redid some patches for configure.in
  * Reviewed old changes in the source code. Bugs dealt with: #22743
    (Incorrect error message), #22744 (wmaker contains sloppy code),
    #23708 (wm overwrites configuration files) (closes: bug#22743,
    bug#22744, bug#23708)
  * Browse buttom for selecting the appicon works, forgot to close the
    bugreport (closes: bug#20771)
  * Bug #24753 (asload shift the screen) is not reproducible and has
    nothing to do with WindowMaker (or asclock, either) (closes:
    bug#24753)
  * Bug #24756 (Messes up afterstep) has already been taken care of
    (0.15.0-0), the only problem is no version beyond 0.14.1-7 will ever
    be installed on hamm (closes: bug#24756)
  * Added dependency for debianutils (>= 1.6) because of 'tempfile'
    (closes: bug#25323)
  * The problem with -DX_LOCALE has been fixed in 0.19.3-2; thanks to all
    the people that reported the problem (too many to name here); special
    thanks to Branden Robinson for taking care of the problem *really
    fast* (closes: bug#26401, bug#26430)
  * Modified WindowMaker/Themes/OpenStep: .jpeg extension removed from
    background image filename. Same for the Night theme. (closes:
    bug#26885)
  * wmaker now suggests wmakerconf. It doesn't recommend it because of
    WPrefs.app (closes: bug#24978)
  * my own experience says bug#22160 (exit session doesn't terminate
    netscape) is fixed (I could reproduce it in the past) (closes:
    bug#22160)
  * wmaker handles off-screen menus better; I just realized that (don't
    know which version fixed this) (closes: bug#24089)
  * Ok. There. One or two bugs remain open. Working on those. :-)
  * debian/rules: added WPREFSSRCDIR. Holds the source dir for WPrefs.app
  * Added -D_REENTRANT to libraries.
  * Added -D_SVID_SOURCE when XSHM is in use.
  * Undefined BIRTH_ANIMATION in src/wconfig.h.in; it's hideous, I won't
    include that.
  * Removed sentence about WMsound not available as a package in
    debian/control.
  * Removed convertstyle-related stuff from debian/rules as that script is
    not longer distributed with wmaker.

wmaker (0.19.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Cleaned Makefile a bit... spotted the bug where Background/\(*\).ext
    wasn't moved to Background/\1
  * Upstream includes GIF support now (yucks!). Compiled against
    libungif. libwraster changed a bit because of this; bumped the
    dependency information.
  * Changed shlibs.local *again*; reading xlib6g's changelog reveals
    X's maintainer introduced -DX_LOCALE on version 3.3.2.3-1:
       "config/cf/linux.cf: build with -DX_LOCALE flag, which fixes a
        number of obscure locale problems"

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Sep 1998 09:25:30 -0600

wmaker (0.19.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Woha! First time that debian's diff.gz applies cleanly. Ever. (New
    upstream version)
  * Moved /usr/share/GNUstep to /usr/lib/GNUstep
  * Modified the Makefile to cope with a future different location of
    GNUstep
  * Moved WPrefs to /usr/X11R6/bin/WPrefs and put a relative symlink in
    the lib/GNUstep/Apps directory.
  * Included xlib6g in shlibs.local to work arround the bug in
    xlib6g-dev. It requires xlib6g (>= 3.3.2.1) which is the oldest one I
    know works.
  * Fixed WINGs/wapplication.c to reflect the change from /usr/share to
    /usr/lib

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Sep 1998 15:20:08 -0600

wmaker (0.19.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version with most (all?) of the patches applied.
  * Included WPrefs' README.
  * Manpages integrated upstream (yeah!). wmaker.1x should still be a bit
    Debian specific, so there's a local copy.
  * Moved convertstyle.1 to /usr/man/man1/convertstyle.1 in debian/rules

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Sep 1998 08:50:34 -0600

wmaker (0.19.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed WINGs-flags on debian/rules:clean
  * Documenting changes is *good*... remembering to do so is also
    good. Changes in 0.19.0-1:
    - applied patch by Jim Knoble to pot files
    - applied patch by Alfredo Kojima to fix some problems with WINGs
    - modified configure.in to get it to pass correct gnustep_dir and
      gnustep_defaults_dir to other makefiles.
    - moved a bunch of old stuff from debian/ into debian/old_releases and
      the custom package stuff into debian/custom
    - modified debian/upgrade-windowmaker-defaults to cope with YAKMC (yet
      another key name change) in G/D/WMWindowAttributes that makes
      WindowMaker crash upon start.
    - Put a symlink /usr/share/WindowMaker/Defaults ->
      /etc/GNUstep/Defaults until I get to figure out where the h*ll are
      some functions getting /usr/share/WindowMaker/Defaults from.
    - Changed README.Debian, spells out some upgrade issues.
  * Changed shlibs.local entries
  * Changed README.Debian again. Lowered a bit the tone of the warning.
  * Added a sed scriptlet to debian/rules to fix the location of WPrefs in
    WMState.
  * Submited bugs against lintian regarding warnings about menu structure.
  * Fixed mess up with $critical_version in wmaker.postinst.tmpl and added
    a proper comment to remind myself how $critical_version is suppossed
    to be set.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Sep 1998 17:30:41 -0600

wmaker (0.19.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

wmaker (0.18.1b-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Patched src/dialog.c to get the Icon browser dialog NOT to ignore
    some valid paths in GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker
  * Removed second instance of ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Pixmaps in
    WindowMaker/Defaults/WindowMaker.in, which I don't know how got there
    in the first place.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Aug 1998 16:14:06 -0600

wmaker (0.17.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Aug 1998 17:45:47 -0600

wmaker (0.17.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created new package libwings-dev to provide support for WINGs-based
    applications, like Aeleron and wmss.
  * Updated wmaker.1x
  * Modified the appearance.menu, yet again.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Aug 1998 17:12:07 -0600

wmaker (0.17.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed src/defaults.c to look for DEFAUTLS_DIR in DEF_GNUSTEP_DIR, which
    is defined as /etc/GNUstep in Debian. (closes: bug#25207)
  * Fixed README.Debian (closes: bug#25208) and added some extra notes.
  * Changed postinst to ask about upgrading the defaults only if it's
    requiered.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Jul 1998 10:05:16 -0600

wmaker (0.17.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Adds GNUstep/Library/Icons and moves icons to
    that directory, but this version still looks in G/L/W/Pixmaps to
    preserve backwards compatibility.
  * Added XConsole to WMWindowAttributes (closes: bug#22405).

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Jul 1998 14:54:46 -0600

wmaker (0.17.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

wmaker (0.17.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Give me a break! Three versions in three
    days... I haven't even been able to test and upload the previous
    ones. :-)
  * Changed upgrade-windowmaker-defaults to cope with new changes (/me
    sees bug reports coming this way, I'm working on a fix to stop the
    script asking the same questions over and over again)

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Jul 1998 08:49:27 -0600

wmaker (0.17.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Removed wmaker-sound.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Jul 1998 08:53:13 -0600

wmaker (0.16.1-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. wmaker-superfluous and wmaker-traditional are
    gone :-( (I liked that little kludge of mine, it served me well ;-)
    Changed control, postinst and postrm accordingly.
  * Added a new package to compensate for the lost of the other two:
    wmaker-sound (it was about time!). It's not tested, and WMSound is not
    Debianized, I don't promise anything.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Jul 1998 09:23:30 -0600

wmaker (0.16.0-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Modified rootmenu.c to get OPEN_MENU to work.
  * Modified "our" wmaker script. It doesn't copy the global files
    now. WindowMaker will happly read the global ones.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Jul 1998 13:04:19 -0600

wmaker (0.15.1-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Version 0.15.0-0 was not uploaded to master.
  * Fixed bug from version 0.15.0-0: a typo in /usr/X11R6/bin/wmaker
    prevented WindowMaker from starting.
  * First attempt to ease upgrade from version 0.14.1-6. It still doesn't
    upgrade smoothly.
  * Applied several patches from the WindowMaker list. Most important: a
    memory leak problem/bogus requests handling patch by Pete Bentley
    (pete@sorted.org), that incidentally allows cgoban to run (closes
    #00000); a patch by Jim Knoble (jmknoble@pobox.com) that fixes
    handling of WorkspaceBack = none (allows running xearth, for example)

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Jun 1998 17:25:55 -0600

wmaker (0.15.0-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version available. New features: The Fiend is gone. The
    Clip is here. Theme support improved. Better dithering, performs
    better on low end systems. Workspaces are more independent of each
    other. 
  * Rearranged directory layout. Should support themes better. Is not
    really FSSTND complaint, because the FSSTND doesn't really say
    anything about /usr/share, but it goes better with the FHS.
  * Removed asclock from the package
  * Tried to clean debian/rules a bit
  * Patch from 0.14.1-2 incorporated upstream
  * Patches applied in 0.14.1-6 incorporated upstream
  * Patch from wmaker list applied. It looks like it crashed under certain
    conditions involving autofocus and attract icons.
  * Patched to get wmaker in line with FSSTND... again. Sent upstream...
    again. Menus and GNUstep/Defaults are configuration files, damm it!
  * This package doesn't make a smooth transition from 0.14.1-6 (in hamm)
    to this version, hence the release number. This package is expected to
    be buggy. I need feedback!
  * Updated the manpages.

wmaker (0.14.1-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added menu.prehook and menu.posthook to the default menu. The menu
    file still puts Exit, Exit Session and Restart under WindowManagers,
    but users can copy /usr/lib/menu/wmaker to /etc/menu/wmaker, edit it,
    and edit /etc/X11/WindowMaker/menu.posthook to "move" those items
    outside the WindowManagers menu. (closes: bug#20194)
  * Patched src/moveres.c to get rid of a bug that can make WindowMaker
    crash when using "outline" mode for moving and resizing windows.
  * Patched wrlib/context.c to include an improved dithering
    algorithm. It is now possible to start *most* of the WindowMaker
    applets at the same time. (closes: bug#19764)

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sun, 10 May 1998 15:31:23 -0600

wmaker (0.14.1-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed README.Debian to give pointers to some real documentation. This
    should take care of some bugs (closes: bug#20483)

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Apr 1998 20:18:57 -0600

wmaker (0.14.1-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed behaviour if /etc/X11/window-managers doesn't exist when
    postinst is run. It properly creates the file with more or less the
    same contents xbase creates it (comments explaining what the files
    does, plus entries for twm and wmaker). (closes: bug#21315)
  * 0.14.1-3 was stupidly uploaded ONLY to unstable.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Apr 1998 14:49:21 -0600

wmaker (0.14.1-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed src/text.c to make WindowMaker display inverse text on input
    when MB support is on (Debian's package uses MB). Patch sent upstream.
    (closes: bug#20488)
  * Modifies rules to make config.guess and config.sub executable and
    allow debbuild to do its job (closes: bug#20962)

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Apr 1998 14:53:56 -0600

wmaker (0.14.1-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Fixes several bugs. Outstanding: bug that made
    fiend's rewind button to not work on PPC (doesn't mention which OS, I
    presume it's Linux); bug that caused crash in certain conditions when
    using Sloppy focus; small mem-leak when destroying a workspace; bug
    when loading missing domains that caused WindowMaker to crash; bug in
    attribute editor that incorrectly create the appicon for an
    application, and could make WindowMaker to crash in certain
    conditions.
  * Upstream's added features: complete theme support (spixmap and tpixmap
    now work); Fiend enhancements (the idle indicator now lights if
    Fiend's not collapsed)
  * Fixed several lintian warnings related to excecutable .la files.
  * /etc/menu-methods/* are excecutable files in the deb (lintian); it
    doesn't make sense to -x them
  * Wrote manpages for several utilities included with WindowMaker
    (getstyle, setstyle, savews, geticonset, seticons, wdwrite, wxcopy,
    wxpaste and wmsetbg)
  * Fixed a few update-wmstyle-menu glitches: non-sense actions when ran
    as root; doesn't update the root menu when run; looks for themes
    (*.theme).
  * moved convertstlye to /usr/doc/wmaker directory. It's a tcl script,
    and it's useful ONLY to people upgrading from 0.6.3 who want to
    convert the old styles to the new ones. It's not as useful as it
    sounds, because it's easier to start over.

wmaker (0.14.0-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "Suggests: menu" as per discussion on debian-bugs-dist.
  * Polished package descriptions.
  * Previous release (0.14.0-3) fixed a bug that prevented the package
    from installing on some systems, notably those where 0.6.3-1 has been
    used before, i.e., bo systems, and long ago installed hamm systems,
    but the fact wasn't noted on the changelog. (closes: bug#19585,
    bug#19836, bug#19560)

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Mar 1998 21:27:45 -0600

wmaker (0.14.0-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch to wrlib. Better dithering for low end systems; uses an
    smaller fraction of the colorspace.
  * Reworked preinst and postinst script to handle the existance of a
    diversion of asclock by wmaker 0.6.3-1, and upgrades from that version.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@efis.ucr.ac.cr>  Sun, 22 Mar 1998 18:54:41 -0600

wmaker (0.14.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed postinst. It's "tempfile", not "tmpfile"! Removed extra
    whitespace. Rewrote some parts (closes: bug#19560, bug#19585)
  * Cleaned preinst
  * Added WindowMaker-happy version of asclock to the package, because
    asclock is not available as a package but instead it's packaged together
    with AfterStep. Added diversion of asclock to asclock.afterstep because
    it does NOT requiere WindowMaker.

wmaker (0.14.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, sporting an all new Fiend clone!
  * New maintainer, Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>.
  * The libtool patch that 0.13.1-0.1 depended on has been incorporated on
    the Debian package, but not upstream. One has to be careful as to ALWAYS
    run libtoolize --copy in order to get Debian's version instead of
    upstream's.
  * Previous version wasn't uploaded. It closed several lintian reported
    bugs and a nasty bug that wiped user modified files (closes: bug#17664)
  * Conffiles are absolute (closes: bug#18501)
  * Modified postinst. It will, hopefully, ask the user to modify
    /etc/X11/window-managers to make WindowMaker the default only if there's
    no previous WindowMaker entry there. It handles a rather curious syntax
    used by AfterStep's postinst which will deinstall WindowMaker's entry
    when AfterStep is deinstalled from the system (I think).
  * Changed a couple of file names in debian.
  * Wrote a manpage for wmaker.
  * Ran several files through ispell. Gosh! Hope I my grammar not as bad as
    my spelin is.

wmaker (0.13.1-0.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * /etc/menu-methods/wmaker and /etc/menu-methods/wmstyle are
    configuration files. (closes: bug#17664)
  * /usr/X11R6/bin/wmaker is no longer a configuration file
  * Fixed a couple of bugs in postrm. (remove and purge were not working
    according to policy)
  * Updated to Standards 2.4.0.0
  * Fixed FSF address (lintian)
  * Fixed undocumented manpage references, 1x -> 7 (lintian)
  * conffiles are absolute (lintian)
  * inter-library dependency information included, but depends on
    patch for libtool not in the main distribution (lintian)

wmaker (0.12.3-0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed menu entry and handling of menu file. Many many thanks Joey!
    (fixes: bug#17014)
  * Fixes a stupid typo in libwmaker0 postinst (fixes: bug#16919,
    bug#17359, bug#17335, bug#17392)
  * libwmaker0-dev, which now replaces wmlib-dev, doesn't have a typo
    in depends (fixes: bug#16666)
  * Added wmaker-traditional, per user's request. This is yet another
    alternative; it doesn't have the newstyle look.
  * Changed Priorities to optional for all the packages.

wmaker (0.12.3-0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned debian/rules to include Section and Priority in the packages
  * Changed Priorities for wmaker-superfluous, libwmaker0, libwmaker0-dev
    and libwraster0-dev to extra.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@efis.ucr.ac.cr>  Sun, 18 Jan 1998 17:24:21 -0600

wmaker (0.12.3-0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added wmaker-superfluous package per user's request.
  * Appended Neil's changelog to this one.
  * Bugs closed in previous releases: focusing problem fixed (#14038);
    wxcopy and wxpaste are included (#14100); compiled using gnulibc 2 and
    g-libraries (closes #14799); postrm seems to be ok (closes #15651);
    preserves z-order during restarts (closes #11371)

wmaker (0.12.3-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a serious mistake regarding wmaker.inst. Removed the script from
    the package and all references to it from the program. Added another
    script wmaker, and renamed the original wmaker to WindowMaker.
  * Fixed entries in wmaker's configuration, to get it in sync with
    whatever goes in the package, and not whatever is on my system. <g>

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@efis.ucr.ac.cr>  Mon, 29 Dec 1997 09:53:18 -0600

wmaker (0.12.3-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Converted to debhelper
  * First Public Release announced on debian-devel and wmaker@eosys.com
  * Upstream version drops patches from 0.12.0-0.1 :^( (according to Dan
    Pascu <dan@services.iiruc.ro>, he never got the patches, they will be
    hopefully incorporated again in the next release) so they are in the
    source package diffs again.
  * Some fine tuning to the libtool patches. It now compiles ok and wmaker
    uses wrlib!!!
  * Patched source code (sent upstream) to preserve z-order during
    restarts. (closes #11371)
  * Modifications to the menu file to incorporate Debian menu system.
  * Added --with-gnustepdir to configure.in (sent upstream); this allows
    to build WindowMaker in a FSSTND complaint fashion.
  * Modified PixmapPath (again?!?) to make it Debian friendly.
  * Moved .so symlinks from base packages to development packages (debian
    policy)

    wmlib, but wmaker doesn't use them

  * Non maintainer release. Changed debian version to make it policy
    complaint
  * Modified configure.in to add --with-pixmapdir. Patch sent to upstream
    maintainer.
  * Yet another try at pixmaps. This one seems to be the definite one; it

  * Upstream version seems to have corrected focusing problem (closes
    #14038)
  * wxcopy and wxpaste included (closes #14100)
  * Compiled using gnulibc 2 and g-libraries (closes #14799)

    for his config file examples.  Thanks also to others who have made
    suggestions.)  (Fixes Bug#10677)

    libraries and header files.  A package with shared libraries may
    follow once the interfaces settle down a bit.

  * Now builds asclock (patched to work with the Dock) and installs it,
    diverting the version from afterstep (if installed) in the process.
