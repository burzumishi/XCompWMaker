.SH SYNOPSIS
.B upgrade-windowmaker-defaults
.SH DESCRIPTION
Some old versions of Window Maker used different names or different syntax
for some configuration options, which in turn used to cause some newer
versions of Window Maker not to start up correctly.  Nowadays this is no
longer a problem but this utility is provided to support upgrades from these
old versions of Window Maker.
