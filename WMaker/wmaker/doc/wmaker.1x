.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker
general Window Maker defaults.
.TP
.B ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMState
information about the Dock and Clip. DON'T edit this while running
Window Maker. It will be overwritten.
.TP
.B ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMRootMenu
Contains the name of the file to read the root menu from or the
menu itself, in property list format.
.TP
.B ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMWindowAttributes
Attributes for different application classes and instances. Use the
Attribute Editor (right drag the application's title bar, select
Attributes) instead of modifying this file directly. There are just a
few options not available using the Attributes Editor.
.TP
.B /usr/share/WindowMaker/Defaults/
All the above-mentioned files are READ from here if not found except
for WMState, which is COPIED from here. No matter where they are read
from, if it's necessary to write configuration changes back into this
files, user's files will be written to.
.TP
.B ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/autostart
This script is automatically executed when Window Maker is started.
.TP
.B ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/exitscript
This script is automatically executed immediately before Window Maker is 
exited.
.B Note:
If you need to run something that requires the X server to be running
from this script, make sure you do not use the
.I SHUTDOWN
command from the root menu to exit Window Maker. Otherwise, the X server
might be shut down before the script is executed.
.TP

The menu file indicated in WMRootMenu is looked for here...

Window Maker looks for \fBpixmaps\fP here
.TP
.B ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Backgrounds/
Window Maker looks for backgrounds here
.TP
.B ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Styles/
Window Maker looks for style files here (not true... it looks like it

to keep things nicely ordered)

Window Maker looks for theme files here (ibid)
.TP
.B /usr/share/WindowMaker/Pixmaps/

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT
specifies the initial path for the Defaults directory. "Defaults/" is
appended to this variable to determine the actual location of the
databases. If the varialbe is not set, it defaults to "~/GNUstep"
.IP GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT
specifies the location of the system-wide \fBlocal\fP GNUstep
directory (this is useful, for example, in those cases where the
system-wide location is really a network wide location). If this
variable is empty, GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT is looked for.
.IP GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT
specifies the location of the system-wide GNUstep directory. If this
variable is empty, it defaults to /etc/GNUstep
