<b><i>Window Maker</b>
<Img src=upbtn.xpm></i>is the GNU window manager 
for the X Window System. It was
designed to emulate the look and feel of part of the NEXTSTEP(tm) GUI. Its
supposed to be relatively fast and small, feature rich, easy to configure and 
easy to use, with a simple and elegant appearance borrowed from NEXTSTEP(tm).
<p>
<b>Window Maker</b> was designed keeping integration with GNUstep in 
mind and is the
"official" window manager for it. It is also part of the GNU project
(<u>www.gnu.org</u>) 

<p>
<b>What is <i>GNUstep?</i></b><p>
<i><b>G</i>NU</b>step is a complete object-oriented development system, based on the
OpenStep specification released by NeXT(tm) (now Apple(tm)) and Sun(tm). It will provide everything one needs to produce cross-platform, object-oriented, graphical (and non-graphical) applications; providing among other things, base system libraries, a high-level GUI application framework that uses a Display PostScript(tm)-like imaging model (DGS), objects for accessing relational databases, distributed objects and a graphical development environment, with tools like interface modeller, a project management system
(project center) and other tools.
<p>
The GNUstep development system will be used to create a user environment,
with everything needed for a complete graphical user interface, such as a
file viewer, text editors and other applications. Note that the user
environment (or "desktop environment") is only a small part of the whole
GNUstep project and therefore it does not "compete" with other projects like
KDE or GNOME, simply because they are completely different things.
