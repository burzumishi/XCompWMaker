WindowMaker raster graphics library

This library is used to manipulate images and convert them to
a format that can be displayed through the X window system.
Read the wraster.h header for an idea of what is available

The following environment variables control some parameters:

RIMAGE_CACHE <integer>

Is the maximum number of images to store in the internal cache.
Default is 8

RIMAGE_CACHE_SIZE <integer>

Is the size of the biggest image to store in the cache.
Default is 4k (64x64)



Porting
=======

It should be fairly easy to port it to other environments 
(svgalib, libggi etc), probably only requiring wraster.h,
context.c and convert.c to be changed. Note that the X specific
code should be disabled in that case, including support for libXpm.
