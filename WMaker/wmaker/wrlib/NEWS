RLightImage: ADDED

API change
----------

To allow a retain/release mechanism to be implemented for RImages, the
following new functions were introduced:

   RImage* RRetainImage(RImage* image);
   void RReleaseImage(RImage* image);

RDestroyImage() is now aliased to RReleaseImage(), but because it's no
longer compatible with the new semantics, it was only kept to allow a
smoother transition and the ability to run programs that were not updated
yet.

Do _NOT_ continue to use RDestroyImage(), because it will be removed in a
future version. You should start using RReleaseImage() in your code, and
also update all your existing programs to use RReleaseImage().

Also keep in mind that its name is also misleading: RDestroyImage() no
longer destroys images, unless they are not retained in some other place.

All existing code will continue to function with the new lib, even if not
recompiled, but you are encouraged to update your code to these changes
