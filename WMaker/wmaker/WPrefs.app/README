			          WPrefs.app
				  ==========

 		  The WindowMaker Prerefences Application
		

    WPrefs.app is the preferences "editor" for the WindowMaker window 
manager. It can be used to set most of the preference options of WindowMaker
and define it's applications menu. It also can change some settings 
that do not belong to WindowMaker. 

    Although WPrefs.app is designed to be easy to use, you should read the
user guide to be fully aware of all available options and other features
of WindowMaker that are not related to configuration.

    To run WPrefs, do not put it in your search path. Instead, run it
with the full path, like /usr/local/GNUstep/Applications/WPrefs.app/WPrefs
Then, dock it's application icon. The dock will automatically detect it's
icon and use it.

    If you change configuration often, you might want to leave WPrefs
always running, leaving it hidden while not in use. You can also make it
be automatically started with WindowMaker and toggle the Start Hidden
option in the attributes panel for the WPrefs window. Of course, it will
use some memory, but by leaving it hidden it'll probably be swapped out and
stay there until you unhide it.

    WPrefs is still under development. Some of the configuration options are 
not yet configurable from WPrefs, notably the appearance related options.
It might contain bugs that can corrupt your configuration files, so backup
the contents of the ~/GNUstep/Defaults directory before using it.



License
-------

    Like Window Maker, WPrefs is distributed with through the General Public
License (as stated in the file COPYING). 

Notes
-----

The mouse speed configuration is saved as a call for xset in 
~/G/D/L/W/autostart. WindowMaker calls this file when it is started.

If you don't want or can't use the menu definition section, do not
open it's section (or if you do open it, do not Save), or WPrefs will
overwrite your ~/G/D/WMRootMenu file.

Only options that have different values than what is found in the 
system-wide configuration file is saved.

WPrefs only supports property list menus. If you have a plain text file
menu, it will not be read by WPrefs. You can either recreate the menu from
scratch or not use WPrefs for menu definition. The old menu will not be
overwritten if you recreate it.


Build
-----

WPrefs will be built automatically and installed with the rest of WindowMaker.



Customized Installation
-----------------------

By default, WPrefs.app will be installed in the GNUstep applications directory, 
which is /usr/local/GNUstep/Applications. If you want to install it somewhere 
else, like in /some_weird_path/Applications, set the GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT
environment variable to some_weird_path before running configure for
WindowMaker. You can also configure Window Maker supplying the --with-gnustepdir
option to configure, like ./configure --with-gnustepdir=/usr/GNUstep/Applications
If you change your mind after installing, you can move the .app directory 
to one of the following GNUstep/Applications directories:

/usr/GNUstep/Applications

OR

/usr/local/GNUstep/Applications

OR

~/GNUstep/Applications
