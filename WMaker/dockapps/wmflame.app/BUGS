Sometimes (I don't know when), there's a line of junk at the top of the 
applet.  This may be fixed as of 0.4.
Color maps can't be changed without a hassle and a recompile.

FIXED:
Forgot to close a file handle in 0.40, resulting in the failure of the load meter.

FIXED:
fclose (0) was sometimes executed.  This is fixed in 0.42.

FIXED:
changing color maps reset parameters.
