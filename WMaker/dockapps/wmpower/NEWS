wmpower 0.4.3 (25 Nov 2008):
- Added new command line arguments to be able to force wmpower to use
  our values for minimum and maximum brightness.
- Added some more checks to prevent segfaults on rare occasions.
- Removed support for lin-seti as the original Seti@Home
  project has shut down its activities.
- Fixed linker arguments to prevent issues compiling with -as-needed.

wmpower 0.4.2 (22 Jul 2005):
- Fixed a memory allocation issue that on rare occasions could make
  wmpower crash.
- Fixed small bug that made wmpower print forever that it would not
  fast charge the battery as it was already at maximum capacity.
- When calculating battery time, and battery is charging, now wmpower
  displays time remaining until battery is fully charged instead of
	how much time would be left if we were running on battery power.

wmpower 0.4.1 (25 Feb 2005):
- Fixed bug, reported by Pezhman Givy <phg@snafu.de>,
  that made wmpower crash on startup when checking for cpufreq
  support, if this support wasn't there...


wmpower 0.4.0 (23 Feb 2005):
- Added option to redirect wmpower output to the system logger.
- Added support for CPU frequency scaling (2.6 kernels only).
- Now wmpower calculates battery time directly if it fails
  to get it from ACPI, APM, or whatever other means...
  It is far less accurate, but at least you get some
  numbers ;-)
- Added small fix to make it compile on ppc hardware...
  Problem reported by Benjamin Rich <rich@math.fu-berlin.de>
- Added '-geometry' command line argument, thanks to
  Johan Vromans <jvromans@squirrel.nl>
- Don't allow manual PM status changes (i.e. actions
  triggered by wheel mouse up/down, button clicks)
  when in 'mo_meddling' mode. Bug reported by
  gabor papp <rod AT inf DOT bme DOT hu>
- Fixed a battery (mis)ordering issue, thanks to
  Michel Ganguin <michel.ganguin@epfl.ch>
- Added support for any number of fans under generic ACPI.
- Fixed code so that wmpower doesn't fail compilation in some
  circumstances complaining about symbols already defined
- Added compile optimizations for K6 and Athlon-64 processors
- Random minor bug fixing ;-)


wmpower 0.3.1 (18 March 2004):
- Added machine id for Toshiba Satellite Pro 6100
- Added machine id for Toshiba Portege 2010
- Added machine id for Toshiba Satellite 5005 S504
- Now wmpower searches for /proc files to read
  for AC status and temperature from instead of
  relying on internal lists of files to try out
- Fixed battery detection code: now batteries are
  presented in the correct order
- reworked some functions (those that get acpi status)
  to be less resource intensive
* under ACPI now we correctly display the time to full charge
  when the battery is charging
* the battery symbol is not shown as critical (blinking),
  if the battery is charging
* two new options added:
  -w   to specify any command to execute when the remaining
       time sinks to a threshold
  -W   the threshold of remaining time in minutes.
* Code contributed by Ondrej Bojar <obo@cuni.cz>)


wmpower 0.3.0 (22 October 2003):
- Added machine id for Satellite Pro 6000
- Added support for hardware manifatured by Compal
  and used by vendors such as Acer, HP, Toshiba...
  You probably need to patch to your kernel to
  enable support for this. See file README.compal
  for all details. Credits and a big thank you go to
  Francisco Rodrigo Escobedo Robles <frer@pepix.net>
  who contributed this code.
- Added spec file for RPM creation, thanks (again) to
  Francisco Rodrigo Escobedo Robles.
- Yet another /proc file to read temperature from,
  thanks to Masahide Matsumoto <masahide@masahide.dip.jp>


wmpower 0.2.0 (30 September 2003):
- Project moved to autoconf/automake tools
- General code reorganization
- Hopefully lessened high CPU usage problems
	Note for DELL users: your problem sits in
	ACPI, not wmpower, so I can't help you :-(
	Try setting a higher polling interval
- Added option to set wmpower polling interval
- You can now choose which battery to monitor
- Added machine id for Toshiba Libretto L2
- Fixed bug that on some machines showed battery charge > 100%
- Added initial support for Dell laptops, thanks to
  code contributed by Massimo Battistel <mbat@libero.it>
	and revised by myself:
	- battery
	- fans (shows number of active fans)
	- temperature
- added another proc file to read temperature from
  (  patch contributed by Christian Schlamkow
     <christian.schlamkow@bau.uni-rostock.de>  )
- if battery charge is critical, not beep if AC power is on
  (  patch contributed by Christian Schlamkow
     <christian.schlamkow@bau.uni-rostock.de>  )
- Other things I'm forgetting to mention ;-)


wmpower 0.1.3 (04 June 2003):
- Various code clean-ups
- Made diagnostic messages a bit less 'scary'
- Fixed a segfault when using a malformed -B option
- New feature (for Toshiba): now wmpower tries to use acpi
	to set lcd brightness; if this fails it tries using
	hardware calls. This should work for newer Toshibas,
	where the hardware method fails
- New feature (for Toshiba): you can now adjust lcd
	brightness using your mouse wheel, step by step.
	Notice: right now, this works only for ACPI calls


wmpower 0.1.2 (21 March 2003):
- Makefile tweaks to make it aware of Gentoo Linux CFLAGS


wmpower 0.1.1 (19 March 2003):
- add support for CPU detection for compile optimizations
- different install for root/normal user


wmpower 0.1.0 (11 March 2003):
- First public release
