- Split the program in two parts:
  - powerd daemon, which will do all the low level power management stuff
  - wmpower proper, which will be an interface to powerd, this way writing
    other user interfaces (kde, gnome...) will become much easier as the
    dirty stuff will be all in one place.
- Add theme support
- Allow for multiple warning/commands for different configurable battery levels...
