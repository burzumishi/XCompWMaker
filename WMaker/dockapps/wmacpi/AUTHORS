 some weird dude who generated a lot of random noise about my dockapp and
 forced me to change the name to wmacpi.  general asshole.

 portions of master.xpm that i was too lazy to draw (the plug and battery
 icons) came from wmapm-2 by jedgar.  the numbers were copied off some other
 dockapp, too.  the button was drawn by ME. PHEAR YES PHEAR IT.
