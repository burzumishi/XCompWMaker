2007 July 13 2.2rc1
 * Make sure that everything works properly on modern kernels.

2004 January 18 1.99r3
 * Correctly handle changing batteries at runtime, if possible. Note
   the bug reported by Joey Hess against wmacpi 1.33 . . .

2003 November 23 1.99
 * Expand libacpi to handle everything else under
   /proc/acpi. Basically, make it into a full ACPI reporting library.

 * Make the command line tool a complete replacement for Grahame
   Bowland's acpi tool, so that wmacpi won't conflict with it.

2003 July 6 0.50
 * Fix the non-deb installation - as it stands, it doesn't even try.

 * Yet more cleanups.

2003 June 24 0.14

 * Still more code cleanups - there's a considerable amount of dumb
   stuff in there still . . .

 * Display time left for battery charging. But first make sure that
   this will actually work with other systems.

 * Turn libacpi into a real library?

2003 May 30 0.10

 * More code cleanups, particularly in the various display functions.

 * Full handling of multiple batteries.

 * Add some kind of progressive display of power consumption, roughly
   similar to what wmmon displays for cpu usage (possibly as a
   completely seperate display mode, or possibly as a replacement for
   the (completely useless) button).

 * Drop APM support (maybe?).

2003 May 26 0.2a

 * Restructure power state handling - split it into a boolean AC
   on/off and a battery status flag.

 * Expand the APMInfo struct to be more useful.

 * Code cleanups . . .
