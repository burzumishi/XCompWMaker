Version         Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.4     * Released 141022

	* Incorporate patches from Debian.

	* Now maintained by Window Maker Developers Team.

1.3b	* Released 980513

	* Splitted up WMPPP and WMiFS into separate programs.

	* WMiFS now uses our 'newstyle' shared dockapps code,
	  it's quite rewritten again.

	* WMiFS now reads /proc/dev/net instead of /proc/net/route.

	* Changed the RC file parsing and handling again.

	* Now ignores DUMMY interface too :)

	* Fixed the 'Zombie' bug :)

	* Better 'execvp' code :)

	* Vastly reduced X CPU usage :)


1.2p1	* Released 980502

        * Updated the docs, sorry, we forgot to update some
          of them, due to some last minute changes in the code
          the docs where incorrect on some parts (systemrc).

        * Updated the Makefile because the systemrc files
          went to the wrong location (due to above changes).

        * Updated the WMPPP rc files, again, due to some last
          minute changes in the code, WMPPP's rc files where
          no longer working properly.


1.2	* Released 980429

	* Completely revamped the WMPPP & WMiFS GUI :)

	* Added 'forceleft, forcemiddle and forceright'
	  options in WMiFS for 'real' multiuser systems,
	  when 'force*' is detected in /etc/wmifsrc the
	  user settings in ~/.wmifsrc are overridden
	  (usefull for sites where users may not fiddle
	   with pppd's options :)

	* WMPPP: Ditto, added 'force' facility here too

	* WMPPP: now correctly redisplays time when killed
          	 and restarted

	* WMPPP: timer now starts to run when the actual
		 connection is made

	* WMPPP: added BAUD CONNECT value display

	* WMPPP: added 'getmodemspeed', a SUID proggie to
	         read the CONNECT value from /var/log/messages

	* WMPPP: dropped the config GUI and added an
	         .wmppprc file instead > motivation to do so:
	         this way, WMPPP is much more platform and
	         distribution independant :)

	* WMPPP: enhanced the status LED, yellow means
	         dialing, green means online, red means error

	* WMPPP: added -display commandline option

	* WMPPP: added -t commandline option, default
	         the timer will display HH:MM, -t will display
	         MM:SS and switch to HH:MM after 60 minutes

	* WMiFS: added support for all interfaces in
	         /proc/net/, now all interfaces are supported :)

	* WMiFS: added -display commandline option

	* WMiFS: added -w commandline option, this will
	         draw the graph in our new 'waveform' look :)

	* WMiFS: fixed the coredump problems that occured
	         on some systems with or without .wmifsrc file
	         typo's, errors, etc. in the .wmifsrc file are
	         now also being ignored/rejected, the worst
	         thing that can happen now is that the scripts
	         do not execute (i.e. luser error) ;-)

	* WMiFS: when monitoring a ppp interface, bytes
	         are used to draw the graph, otherwise packets

	* WMiFS: made the RX/TX/Status LED box identical
	         to the one in WMPPP, the right LED is the status
	         LED, green means interface is working, red means
	         error (interface down, NIC broken, etc.)
