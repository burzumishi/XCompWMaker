Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
WMiFS is a complete network monitoring dock.app, it's mainly
designed for usage in WindowMaker's dock and gives you some
nice & nifty features like:

	* Autosensing of *ALL* active network interfaces;
	* Integrated autoscaling (per interface) transfer
	  statistics, tested upto 100Mbit;
	* Displays a 'normal' xload style graph or our new
	  'waveform' like load graph;
	* Realtime cycling through active interfaces by simply
	  clicking on the eth0/ppp0 (interface) gadget;
	* Integrated RX/TX interface activity LEDs;
	* Integrated interface status LED;
	* Commandline options to force monitoring a particular
	  interface, even 'lo' is supported (-h for help);
	* User-definable scripts for left/middle/right mouse
	  buttons which are read from ~/.wmifsrc (optional);
	* Fixed rc file option, usefull for sites where users
	  are not allowed to mess with pppd;

WMiFS is developped on DEC Alpha machines running RedHat-5.0/Linux,
but, WMiFS has also been intensively tested on x86 and 68K RedHat/
Linux machines ;-)
