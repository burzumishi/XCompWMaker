	Added some stuff so you can see the exact numbers being returned by
	the external programs...

	Made major change as to where wmfire gets the load from.. it now
	calls external programs.. Should make making your own load functions
	a bit easier.. I dunno though.. It'll certainly keep down the size
	of the main program...

	Finally got off my ass and added some stuff... (Ok.. one thing)

	I gave wmfire the ability to read info from a file.. it might not
	be very efficient for large files right now, but I may add some options
	to help with that.. it _should_ be perfectly ok for monitoring
	temperature and the like; I use:
		wmfire -F /proc/sys/dev/sensors/*/temp1 -S %s%s -m 40 -x 55
	to monitor temperatures.. your mileage may vary..

 19/07/1999
	Day after the post on freshmeat..

	applied a patch by Hubert Feyrer that lets it monitor load on NetBSD.

	gave it a new option: '-c', lets you choose the CPU to monitor on SMP
	linux machines..

 26/06/1999
	Decided to do some stuff...

	added more colormaps (changed via new -C option or
	right click whilst running)

	fixed some configure junk

 21/06/1999 (Released as 0.0.1)
	Second day of devel, make load stuff look better and
	made the stuff use GNU autoconf/automake
