	Ok, I wrote this mainly because I was pissed at how much CPU
	wmflame took (it could be easily fixed, however), and I wanted
	to use a fire algo that looks a bit different, and hey, it's
	always nice to have your own dockapps laying around the desktop.

Invoking:
        wmfire	[-L[1|0|on|off|yes|no]] [-B[1|0|on|off|yes|no]]] [-C<0..2>]
        	[-s[1|0|on|off|yes|no]] [-P <program [args [...]]>] [-h]

        -L        Toggles/Sets if flame height follows load
        -B        Toggles/Sets if load bar shows
        -s        Toggles/Sets if the numbers are shown
        -C<0..2> Start at a different colormap
        -P <...>  Set "load program"; will be expanded by shell...
        -h       Shows this short bit of help

Examples:
	Use lm_sensors to follow the temperature of the cpu (at least on my comp):
	wmfire -P "fireload_file -F /proc/sys/dev/sensors/*/temp1 -S '%s%s' -m 40 -x 51"

	Start up wmfire with no bar, and a cyanish flame, and follow load:
	wmfire -B0 -C2

	Start up wmfire with a bar, and follow load but don't show nice'd processes:
	wmfire -P "fireload_file -n"

	Full flame height all the time, no bar, flame with no blue, no numbers:
	wmfire -L0 -B0 -C1 -s0
