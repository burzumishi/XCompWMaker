	wmfire shows the numbers corresponding to the flame height by default
	now (didn't at all before), you can turn this off via -s0

	Now, wmfire will spawn external processes (just once, just one) to
	determine the height of the flame.. Two such programs are included
	with wmfire.. -c, -n, -F, -S, -m, and -x options were removed, now
	there is a -P options to tell wmfire which program to run..

	File stuff below was replaced, as were the default CPU load functions.

-- Dates below here unknown
	wmfire can now read numbers from a file... This should make it able
	to monitor temperature via lm_sensors and /proc/sys/dev/sensors/*
	Added options for this are -S, -F, -m, and -x

	Added -c option to choose the CPU to monitor for SMP linux machines,
	give it a whirl ;)

	Added colormaps/-C option, try it out

	wmfire has a few options, namely -L and -B, they control
	if the fire follows the load, and if the load bar is shown,
	respectively.
