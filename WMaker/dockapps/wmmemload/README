wmmemload is a program to monitor memory/swap usages. It is a dockapp
that is supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep,
BlackBox, and Enlightenment.

The current memory usage is displayed in the top half.  The swap usage
is in the bottom half. It has an LCD look-alike user interface.  The
back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button over the
appliacation. If the usage hits a certain threshold, an alarm-mode will
alert you by turning on back-light.

Run `wmmemload --help` or `man wmmemload` for more information.
