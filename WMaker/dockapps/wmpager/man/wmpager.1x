.SH BUTTON THEMES
.PD
Depending on your WindowMaker theme you might want to use another
theme for wmpager as well. Use option '\-t' or '\-\-theme' to specify
the location of an XPM file (the extension '.xpm' is optional, it has
to be an XPM file though). If you use option '\-i', '\-\-installdir' or
have set the environment variable WMPAGER to the installation location
of the wmpager themes, then you may also skip the path to the theme.

Predefined themes: Well, I'm not much of an artist therefore I've only
included some themes to give you an idea of how a real nice theme
might be done. Naturally, I use the built\-in theme and theme support
is only there because I have been asked to include it...

If you create a theme yourself please send it to me and I'll include it
in the next build.

The list of predefined themes in this release includes:
.PD 0
.IP \(bu 2
blue (the built\-in theme)
.IP \(bu 2
fire
.IP \(bu 2
gray
.IP \(bu 2
steel
.RE 2

Creating your own themes: If you want to create your own theme simply
take one of the included XPM theme files and modify it to your needs.
If you really want to know, the format of the file is described below.

XPM file format: The XPM file has to be at least 102 by 71 pixels in
size. The area 0,0 to 50,50 describes the background for the selected
workspace, the area 51,0 to 101,50 for unselected work spaces. The
area has to include a one\-pixel border that is used for all workspace
buttons. From 0,51 to 89,60 are the digits used for the selected
workspace (each 10x10 pixels, 1\-9 from left to right) and from 0,61 to
89,70 are the digits for unselected workspaces. The digits may have
a transparent background.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
In order for wmpager to work properly you need to have your Window
Maker compiled with Gnome support. (I don't know if this is the case
for the precompiled Window Makers usually found in Linux distributions
since I usually build my Window Maker myself.)

wmpager uses the Gnome support messages sent out by Window Maker to
display the currently active workspace. Without Gnome support the
pager will not automatically adjust the currently active desktop.
