Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
WMMon monitors the realtime CPU load as well the average
system load and gives you some nice additional features too...

WMMon currently provides:

        * Realtime CPU 'stress' meter;
        * Average systemload, like xload & wmavgload;
        * Average systemload graphic is autoscaling;
	* Realtime Disk I/O 'stress' meter;
	* Average Disk I/O load grapic (autoscaling);
	* Realtime total Mem & Swap usage meters;
	* System uptime display;
	* Realtime cycling through all monitor modes;
	* Can lauch 3 user definable commands through ~/.wmmonrc;
	* Can be started multiple times;
	* Commandline options for help (-h), version (-v),
	  start mode (-i & -s) and display (-d);

There are some 'known' unfinished parts, be sure to read the TODO
file, but we decided to release it early because of the high
demand and many requests we got for this one ;)

WMMon is being developped on DEC Alpha machines running
Linux/RedHat-5.0, but, WMMon has been intensively tested
on x86 and 68K Linux machines too ;-)

p.s. WMMon is still a Linux ONLY app, sorry about that :(
