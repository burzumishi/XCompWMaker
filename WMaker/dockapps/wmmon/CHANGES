Version         Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.2b1		- Released 20120325
		- I/O monitor - updated to use /proc/diskstats instead
		  of obsolete /proc/stat interface, which is no longer
		  present in post 2.6 kernels. TODO: The non-/proc based
		  solutions used in the various BSD ports trees should
		  be incorporated into mainline version.
		- I/O monitor - Fixed scaling issues with graph caused
		  by improper use of static data. The graph would
		  continually scale up, making smaller values invisible.
		  Eventually the system would appear to be idle, only
		  graphing the biggest spikes. A similar issue affecting
		  the upper-right meter is also fixed. Meter scaling is
		  recalibrated every couple of minutes to avoid losing
		  meter funtionality after anomalously large peaks.
		- I/O Monitor - Fixed rounding errors caused by use of
		  integer types, which were causing relatively small
		  values not to appear on graph or meter. Added code to
		  round very low values up, so they will appear on meter
		  and graph.
		- ONGOING: Style edits to improve readability and
		  maintainability (removing hardcoded values, adding
		  newlines to "if" conditions, etc).

1.0b2		- Released 980520
		- Vastly reduced CPU usage in CPU & IO mode,
		  MEM/SWAP/UPTIME (i.e. SysInfo) only updated
		  when visible now and now uses global file
		  descriptors to reduce filesystem overhead,
		  based on diff by Dave Harden (dharden@wisewire.com);
		- Fixed memory overflow bug;
		- Memory gauge now displays real used mem, buffered
		  & cached mem are no longer being displayed;
		- Added -i & -s parameters to select startupmode, based
		  on diff by Brendan Knox (knoxy@origob.demon.co.uk);


1.0b1		- Released 980513
		- First initial stable public BETA release.
