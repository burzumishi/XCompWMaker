\fBWMacpiLoad\fP is a program to monitor battery and cpu temp. It is a dockapp
that is supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and
Enlightenment.

The CPU temperature is displayed in the top half.  The battery load percentage
is in the bottom half in two manner : number and graphic. Next to percentage
number are the on-line/on-battery and on-charge status. It has an LCD
look-alike user interface.
The back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button 1 (left)
over the application. If battery status is below a critical level, an
alarm-mode will alert you by turning on and off back-light. This can be
stopped (and restarted) by clicking the mouse button 3 (right) over the
application. An application can be launched when alarm is on to notify
user that level is too low.
By clicking with mouse button 2 (middle), the computer can be put in
STANDBY (default) or SUSPEND mode (with CONTROL key).
