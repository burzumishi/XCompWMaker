I can make no guarantee about this codes functionality on systems other than Linux - I do not
have other OSes to test upon (least ways ones that I regularly boot into). Also keep in mind that
some systems dont support suspend etc in ACPI - as usual the risk is yours. Thats about all I can offer
in the way of advice - feel free to email me <bratag44@hotmail.com> with suggestions etc.
