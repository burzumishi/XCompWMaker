Hints for WMTime

Generic
--------------------------------------------------------------
WMTime supports 4 commandline options:

	-h (help);
	-v (prints);
	-d (display);
	-digital (digital clock);

WMTime can lauch 3 user definable commands for left, middle and
right mouse button clicks, which you can define in ~/.wmtimerc,

left: mycommand-1 &
middle: mycommand-2 &
right: mycommand-3 &

If wmtime detects a ~/.wmtimerc file, it will launch your defined
command(s) when you click in the clock display area.

WMtime can realtime 'morph' it's UI from analog <> digital,
simply left click in either the DAY or DATE gadget ;-)

Be sure to drag WMTime on it's outer edges, WMTime is a bit picky
due to the large gfx pixmap it keeps ;-)


WindowMaker
--------------------------------------------------------------
WindowMaker users simply drag and drop the WMTime dock.app on
the WindowMaker Dock (preferred) or on the Fiend and select
'autolaunch' from the rightmouse button Dock popupmenu.


Afterstep
--------------------------------------------------------------
Afterstep users put the following in their .steprc
"Wharf wmtime - MaxSwallow "wmtime" wmtime &".

Note: AfterStep's Wharf has a problem with pixmaps that are
larger than 60x60 pixels. Please tell the AfterStep authors
to fix this, this is not our fault, but a Wharf problem!


Other WindowManagers
--------------------------------------------------------------
For other windowmanagers, WMTime runs nicely as a 64x64 shaped
icon on your desktop.
