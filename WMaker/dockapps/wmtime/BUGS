Known 'features and easter eggs' in WMTime,
(or in non M$ talk, BUGS).

WMTime 1.0b2
--------------------------------------------------------------
	* Pixmap is not properly updated when starting WMTime
	  with the -digital parameter and being 'cycled' to
	  analog mode (not really a bug, but a beta easteregg,
	  this will be removed in the final 1.0 version) :)


WMTime 1.0b1
--------------------------------------------------------------

	* None 'known' bugs in WMTime so far ;-)
