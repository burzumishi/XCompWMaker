Installation instructions for WMTime.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing particular, but a computer might come in handy doh ;-)


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1)  % tar -zxvf wmtime-1.1.tar.gz
2)  % cd wmtime/wmtime
3)* xmkmf -a (for *BSD systems needed only!).
4)  % make
5)  % make install (as root)

6)* WMTime uses month and weekday abbreviations from the
    currently set locale.  If these abbreviations do not
    use Latin alphabet characters, then WMTime defaults to
    US/English.

    You may change this behavior by setting the LANG
    environment variable, e.g.,

    % LANG=es_MX.UTF-8 wmtime

7)* This Imakefile was kindly donated by Pascal Hofstede but
    untested by the authors because we don't have a *BSD box
    to test and try it out... we're working on generic
    Imakefiles though ;-)

Be sure to read the HINTS and TODO files too!
