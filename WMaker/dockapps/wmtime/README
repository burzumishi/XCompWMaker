Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
WMTime, guess what, displays the time and date and gives you
some nice additional features too...

WMTime currently provides:

        * Time and date;
        * Realtime morphing UI (analog <> digital mode);
        * Autoscaling and anti aliased hands;
	* Locale, can display DAY and DATE in various languages;
	* Can lauch 3 user definable commands through ~/.wmtimerc;
	* Can be run multiple times;
	* Commandline options for help (-h), version (-v), digital
	  clock mode (-digital) and and display (-d);

WMTime is being developped on DEC Alpha machines running
Linux/RedHat-5.0, but, WMTime has been intensively tested
on x86 and 68K Linux machines too ;-)

WMTime also seems to compile and work okay on *BSD and SGI/
IRIX-6.x systems (so we've heard and been told) ;-)
