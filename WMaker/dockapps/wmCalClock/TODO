TODO List
---------

	-  Add in a few more fonts... Graphite would be nice! Or EagleFeather
	   (its a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired font)?

	- Allow fonts to be added externally via some sort of config file...

	- Add alarm clock mode?

	- graphical Moon-Phase Icon in Calendar section.

	- Day numbers in Calendar section. This is something that I would really like myself!

	- Allow Changing of fonts/colors for the main Calendar section.

	- Foreign language support...

	- Add indicators for Greenwich, sidereal, local sideareal time displays (right now
	  you dont really know what it is displaying just by looking at it)...
