Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
Temperature.app is a Window Maker dock application which
fetches local temperature information every 15 minutes from
ftp://weather.noaa.gov and displays it (in Celsius or Fahrenheit).


Hints
--------------------------------------------------------------
The led:
	If the led is blinking (green/red), then that means
	Temperature.app is trying to fetch weather information.
	If successful the led will stop blinking and go green.
	If unsuccessful the led will stop blinking and go red.
	Also, a error message will be printed in the console,
	describing what went wrong. If the error message is
	"wget failed" and you can't figure out why, try using
	option -V, which will cause wget to be run in verbose
	mode.

Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you discover any bugs in this software, please send a
bugreport to per@fukt.bth.se and describe the problem.

caught sight of his program).
