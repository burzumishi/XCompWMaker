wmkeys is a Window Maker and AfterStep dock app which allows you to
quickly switch between different X keymaps, for example QWERTY and
Dvorak. I wrote this so I could easily switch between those two
keymaps as I learned the Dvorak mapping.

Some code was taken from existing dock applications, such as
wmtime. For more information on other dock apps available, see
http://windowmaker.mezaway.org/
