Adding special keys to WindowMaker using built-in functionality.
================================================================

 1. Start xev and press the desired key.  It will display something like:
	KeyPress event...
	root ...
	state ..., keycode CODE (keysym ..., SYMBOL)...
	...

 2. Note down SYMBOL.
    If SYMBOL is NoSymbol, look into /usr/X11/lib/X11/XKeysymDB and pick
    the symbol that best describes your key's functionality (eg: XF86WWW).
    Append the new key to XModmap:
	echo keycode CODE = SYMBOL >> ~/.Xmodmap

 3. Restart WindowMaker.

 4. Create a new menu entry somewhere in ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMRootMenu
	("name", SHORTCUT, "SYMBOL", EXEC, "command"),

Adding special keys to WindowMaker using xhookey.
=================================================

  xhookey -key="[MOD+[MOD+]...]CODE COMMAND"

  MOD is optional, and can be any of Shift, Control or Alt.
  CODE is the desired key's code, as reported by xev.
  COMMAND is the command to be executed (it inherits the DISPLAY of xhookey).

  Much of the xhookey code was taken from xbindkeys.
