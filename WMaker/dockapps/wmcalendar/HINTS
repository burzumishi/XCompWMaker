Hints for wmCalClock

Generic.
--------
% wmCalendar -h

wmCalendar 0.3.0


WindowMaker.
------------
In WindowMaker simply drag and drop the wmCalendar App on the WindowMaker Dock or Clip.


Afterstep.
---------
Afterstep users put the following in their .steprc "Wharf wmCalendar - MaxSwallow
"wmCalendar" wmCalendar &". Dont use Afterstep so I have no idea if it works...

Note: AfterStep's Wharf supposedly has a problem with pixmaps that are larger
than 60x60 pixels. Please tell the AfterStep authors to fix this, this is not
our fault, but a Wharf problem!

Other window managers.
----------------------
wmCalendar shows as a 64x64 shaped icon on your desktop under other window
managers.
