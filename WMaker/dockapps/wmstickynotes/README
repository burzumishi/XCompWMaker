This program is a Window Maker style dockapp which allows you to create note
windows.  The notes, along with their position, size, and color, are stored on
disk and will be restored when wmstickynotes is run again.

Left click the note icon to create a new note with the default color (yellow).

Right click the note icon to get a menu of colors, selecting one of which will
create a new note of that color.

Click the x in the top right of a note to delete it.

Drag the bottom right corner of a note to resize it.

Right click a note to get a popup menu where you can change its color,
cut/paste, etc.
