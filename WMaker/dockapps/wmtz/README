Author....:     Jan Lindblom <99jl@home.se>

Note......:     Since I'm a very lazy programmer, I ripped
                most of the code from the excellent WMiNET
		program. See credits below...

Credits...:
                Patch for local date, local time, weekday and @, and

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
wmtz is a Window Maker dock app derived from the WMiNET
dock app. It displays the local time from different time zones
defined in the configuration file. It can also display the
current Julian Day Number as well as Swatch beats and
sidereal time at Greenwich and local sidereal time and
local time, date and weekday.

This app can be useful (?) for people who have to communicate
in realtime with people from different time zones. It allows
you to avoid making a fool of yourself by calling someone
when they are asleep...
