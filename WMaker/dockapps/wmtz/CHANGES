Program derived from WMiNET. See README file for credits.

v0.2: Added configuration option xxx for empty "time slot"
      on suggestion from "jason".

v0.3: Added configuration option BEATS giving Swatch beats. Patch for this
      came from Joris van Gasteren <fuzzy@nala.demon.nl>.
      Added configuration option Y2K giving number of days to 2000.0.

v0.4 Added configuration options DATE for local date and option WDAY for
     local weekday. Patch for this came from Felipe Gustavo de Almeida
     <galmeida@linux.ime.usp.br>.

v0.5 Added configuration options LOCAL for local date and timezone
     label and @ for Swatch beats in float format.
     Fixed a "glitch" in WDAY option and a BUG in DATE (month).
     Changed sprintf's to snprintf's and some code clean-ups.
     Patch for this version came from Felipe Gustavo de Almeida
     <galmeida@linux.ime.usp.br>.

v0.6 * Added configuration options LMST for local sidereal time and GMST
     for sidereal time at Greenwich. You have to enter your longitude in the
     config file with "longitude=<your longitude in decimal degrees>" for LMST
     to work correctly.
     * Added a configuration/restart/quit menu. Click once on wmtz to make it
     appear. The default editor to edit the config file is xedit. This can be
     changed by setting the environment variable XEDITOR to your favourite X
     editor or by using the new "-e <editor>" command line option. "Restart"
     rereads the configuration file and "Quit" exits wmtz. "Wmtz" takes
     you back to the time table.
     * Added the "-jd" command line option, which allows conversion between
     Julian day numbers and Gregorian dates via CLI interface.
     * Removed options BEATS and Y2K since the former is the same as @ without
     decimals and the latter is history.
     * Added a man-page.
     NOTE: Format of config file have changed and some options have disappeared
     which makes it a good idea to replace old config files with new ones.

v0.7 * Added option TZONE for time zone time with automatic compensation for
     daylight savings time. You have to give a correct TZ environment string
     in order for this to work (see: 'man tzset' for a description of the TZ
     environment variable).
     * Added a monochrome bitmap. Activate it with the -m command line option.
