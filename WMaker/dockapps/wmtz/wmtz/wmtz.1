.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
wmtz displays the time in different time zones and can also show Julian day
numbers, sidereal time, internet time (swatch beats) and local time, date
and weekday. wmtz can also convert between JD and Gregorian dates via a
command line interface. It is configured via a text configuration file,
usually ~/.wmtzrc. If wmtz is clicked on with the mouse it shows a menu
where the configuration can be changed and updated. wmtz can also be shut
down with this menu by clicking on QUIT.

.SH CONFIGURATION
wmtz is configured with a configuration file, usually ~/.wmtzrc. In this
file several values must be given in order for wmtz to function properly.
It is recommended to use the configuration file that follows with the
distribution and modify it according to your needs. wmtz has five "timeslots"
that can show different times.
.br
What must be present in the file is the "time*=<string>" token for every
timeslot (1 to 5), followed by the "utdiff*=<integer>" for every timeslot
(1 to 5) even if it is to be ignored. "longitude=<longitude in decimal
degrees>" must also be given in the config file.
.br
The options available for "time*=" are the following:
.TP
.B ***
Three (or less) letter designation of timezone. utdiff for this timeslot is
subtracted from UT to give time in that timezone.
.TP
.B TZONE
Gives time in timezone described by TZ environment variable string in utdiff. See man page for tzset for a description of the TZ string.
.TP
.B JDN
Gives Julian Day Number. The value for utdiff for the timeslot is subtracted
from the current JD, which enables you to show JD from another epoch.
.TP
.B xxx
Gives a blank (empty) timeslot. utdiff for this timeslot is ignored.
.TP
.B @
Gives swatch beats. utdiff for this timeslot is ignored.
.TP
.B DATE
Gives local date. utdiff for this timeslot is ignored.
.TP
.B WDAY
Gives local weekday. utdiff for this timeslot is ignored.
.TP
.B LOCAL
Gives local time, automatically corrected for summer/winter time. utdiff for
this timeslot is ignored.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B XEDITOR
Can be used to specify which editor to use when clicking on "Config" in the
wmtz menu. See also the "-e <Editor>" option above.
.TP
.B HOME
Must be set for wmtz to find the users config file.
.PP
The config file is
searched for in the following order:
.br
1) User specified config file, if any.
.br
2) $HOME/.wmtzrc
.br
3) /etc/wmtzrc
.SH FILES
.nf
~/.wmtzrc     Users personal configuration file
/etc/wmtzrc   Systems configuration file (usually just a fallback)
.fi
.SH BUGS
Doesn't handle errors in the configuration file very well. Be careful when
editing .wmtzrc.
