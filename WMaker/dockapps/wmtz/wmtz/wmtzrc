# time*=GMST gives sidereal time at Greenwich.
# time*=LMST gives local sidereal time. longitude must be set.
# time*=xxx gives a blank (empty) timeline.
# time*=@ gives swatch beats (float format). utdiff is ignored.
# time*=DATE gives local date. utdiff is ignored.
# time*=WDAY gives local weekday. utdiff is ignored.

#Difference in hours from UT (Greenwich Civil Time) for the time zones above.
#Negative values are required for timezones to the east of Greenwich.
#A value of 0 gives UT.
#
# Automatic correction of daylight saving time changes is supported
#only by TZONE, WDAY, DATE and LOCAL.
#
#If TZONE was specified for a time position, you must give the TZ environment
#variable for the desired time zone in the corresponding utdiff*. See
# "man tzset" for at description of the TZ environment variable string.
#
#If JDN was specified for a time position, this value is subtracted from the
#Julian day number, giving days from another epoch. This enables you to see
#more decimals of the JD if you want to...
#
#Time differences in minutes is supported only for the TZONE option.
