 *
 *      Things TODO:
 *                  - clean up code!
 *                  - more detailed documentation.
 *                  - reduce size of pixmap! Dont need it in one pixmap.
 *		      Aslo, does the hi-color pixmap really need all those colors?
 *                  - add rotation of moon so user sees it as they would in reality?
 *                  - eclipses. The calcs are quite acurate so this should be easily doable.
 *		      (Note the Sun position calcs in CalcEphem are low precision -- high is not
 * 		       as costly as the Moon calcs.) Sun posiiton is calculated but not used yet...
 *		    - Next new moons, next full moons, next quarters, etc...
 *		    - Moon names. I.e. Harvest, Blue, etc...
 *
 *      Changes:
 *      Version 1.28 - 	released September 20, 2011.
 *			Debian patches added to the upstream version. These patches are included:
 *			01_all_previous_diff.diff, 02_update_time.diff, 03_add_southern_hemisphere_support.diff
 *			03_add_southern_hemisphere_support.diff and 04_fix_hyphen_used_as_minus_sign.diff
 *			BUGS file updated to report to wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.info
 *			Source is now at http://repo.or.cz/w/dockapps.git
 *			Updated by Rodolfo García Peñas (kix) <kix@kix.es>
 *
 *      Version 1.27 - 	released June 7, 1999.
 *			fixed a minor bug in computation of azimuth (A in Horizon Coords). Thanks to
 *			Dan Moraru for spotting this one. (There were two SinGlat factors instead of one).
 *
 *      Version 1.26 - 	released April 22, 1999 (?).
 *      Version 1.25 - 	released March 22, 1999.
 *                     	Now auto-detects 8-bit display and forces the LowColor pixmap to
 *			be used. The -low option still works if you need to conserve colors
 *			even on high-color displays.
 *
 *			Added 3 command line options + code to change colors of the data
 *			entries:
 *
 *				-bc <Color> to change background color.
 *				-lc <Color> to change color of labels and headers.
 *				-dc <Color> to change color of data values.
 *
 *      Version 1.24 - 	released February 9, 1999.
 *                     	Added low color support via the -low command line option.
 *
 *      Version 1.23 - 	released February 4, 1999.
 *                     	cosmetic for AfterStep users. removed spurious black line at RHS edge an mask.
 *
 *	Version 1.22 - 	released January 8, 1999.
 *
 *		       	+ Changed PI2 to TwoPi in Moon.c -- Linux Pyth. had probs because
 *                        PI2 was defined in <math.h>.
 *
 *	Version 1.21 -  released January 7, 1999.
 *
 *                     + minor bug fixes in Makefile and manpage.
 *
 *	Version 1.2 - released January 3, 1999.
 *		      Added:
 *
 *			+ Local Time/ Universal Time display.
 *			+ Visible: Yes/No to indicate if Moon is up or not.
 *			+ Frac (percent through orbit -- this is NOT a simple
 *			  conversion of AGE....).
 *			+ Horizon Coords. Altitude is measured up from horizon to
 *			  Moon in degrees. Azimuth is in degrees from due south.
 *
 *       	      Also shuffled things around a bit...
 *
 *
 *
 *	Version 1.1 - released December 24, 1998.
 *                    Fixed bug in AGE calculation. It now should be highly accurate.
 *                    Note that AGE is not the same as Phase*29.530589 ...
 *                    I have checked with the Astronomical Almanac and it agrees very
 *		      well....
 *
 *
 *	Version 1.0 - released December 16, 1998.
