Installation instructions for WMPPP.


NOTE!
--------------------------------------------------------------
Installing this program requires root privileges, ask your
local system/network administrator kindly if she/he wants
to install this software for you ;-)


Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------
- root access

	To be able to complete the installation you'll need
	to make changes in the system's /etc/ directory,
	the installation copies the GLOBAL config files
	there, don't worry, nothing will be overwritten ;-)


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) % tar -zxvf wmppp-1.x.x-tar.gz
2) % cd wmppp.app/
3) % make all
4) % su root
5) # make install
6) # vi ~/.wmppprc
	 set up the paths to your ppp start,
	 stop & restart scripts

7) % wmppp & (try 'wmppp -h &' for help)


Extra Install Info For Site Administrators!
--------------------------------------------------------------
For site administrators who don't want their users messing
up pppd's configuration files, but do want them to be able
to make a dialup connection, a sample system.rc file is
included (system.wmppprc), please take a look at it!

The installation will install standard rc files in $HOME
and /etc/ WITHOUT the 'force' option!

How it works:

WMPPP first scans /etc/ if there is a wmppprc present.

If true, it will scan if the keyword 'force' is trailing
a command, for example 'forceleft' instead of 'left'.

If the keywords 'force' are indeed trailing the 'normal'
commands, all user .wmppprc files will be ignored i.e.
OVERRIDDEN ;-)

If the 'force' keyword is not found in /etc/wmppprc,
WMPPP will scan the users home directory to see if
there is a valid .wmppprc available.

When a valid ~/.wmppprc is found, and no 'force' keyword
is present in /etc/wmppprc, WMPPP will use the users
.wmppprc file instead.

If no wmppprc file is found in the users home directory,
WMPPP will use the global one (/etc/wmppprc).

If NO wmppprc files are found at all, WMPPP will work,
but quite obvious, WMPPP won't launch your scripts.

Make sure there are valid and FULL pathnames in wmppprc
if you want WMPPP to launch your pppd scripts ;-)


General Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------
Note 1: If "make install" fails on your system, please edit
        the Makefile to set the paths according to your setup.
        Make install defaults to /usr/local/bin & /etc/ppp/.

Note 2: Please DO read the HINTS, this file contains some
        very usefull tips and hints about WMPPP.
