WMPPP features all things the standard pppd offers and gives

        * Integrated modem RX/TX LED's;
		* Integrated WMPPP status LED;
        * Integrated autoscaling PPP transfer statistics;
		* Integrated CARRIER/CONNECT display;
		* Integrated bytes/second Speed-O-Meter;
		* Automatic detection of active ppp interfaces;
		* User definable scripts for the V and X buttons and
  		  also for 'ifdown' which are read from ~/.wmppprc;
		* 'force' option in /etc/ppp/.wmppprc for sites
  		  where users are not allowed to mess with pppd;
		* Several commandline options (try '-h' for help);

WMPPP is being developped on DEC Alpha machines running Linux
