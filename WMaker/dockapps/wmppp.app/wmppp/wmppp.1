.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wmppp
.RB [\| \-display
.IR <display\ name> \|]
.RB [\| \-t \|]
.RB [\| \-u
.IR <update\ rate> \|]
.RB [\| \-i

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwmppp.app\fP displays a dynamic representation of the load on the
PPP line on a 64x64 miniwindow. It also starts and stops the
connection and displays the time enlapsed since the it came up. The
traffic on the interface is also monitored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-display <display\ name>
name of display to use
.TP
.B \-t
sets the on-line timer to display MM:SS instead of the default HH:MM.
.TP
.B \-u <update rate>
sets the frequency, in seconds, for updates to the display.  Valid
range is 1-10, default value is 5.
.TP
.B \-i <device>
choose the net device (ppp1, ippp0, etc.) to monitor.  (Note that this
feature is EXPERIMENTAL and should be used with caution.  Bug reports
are welcomed.)
.TP
.B \-h
displays a command line summary
.TP
.B \-v
displays the version number.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration file (see below) may contain any of the following
key-value pairs. The format is \fIkey: value\fP.
.TP
.I start
The program that starts the connection
.TP
.I stop
The program that stops the connection
.TP
.I speed
This program reports the speed of the connection. This program should
output \fI<speed>\fP, that is, a \fInumber\fP is expected and not the
whole \"CONNECT\" line the modem outputs.
.TP
.I ifdown
This program is run if the line goes down, and the \fIstop\fP program
hasn't been run. (Redial program)
.TP
.I stampfile
The modification time of this file is used to calculate the amount of
time the connection has been up. Something like \fItouch <stampfile>\fP
should be run for this to work.
.SH FILES
.TP
/var/run/wmppp.\fIppp0\fP
this is the stamp file use to determine the ammount of time enlapsed
since the connection came up. This file should be managed by the ip-up
and ip-down scripts. On Debian systems, \fI/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00wmppp\fP
creates the file, and \fI/etc/ppp/ip-down.d/00wmppp\fP removes it.
.TP
/etc/wmppprc
System wide defaults
.TP
$HOME/.wmppprc
User defined settings
.TP
/etc/wmppprc.fixed
System wide fixed options, this overrides the user settings
