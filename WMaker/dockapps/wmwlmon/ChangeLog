1.0
===
- FreeBSD note:  the wi_req struct has been removed from the kernel
  in FreeBSD 7.  This makes wmwlmon fail to compile.  The FreeBSD port
  includes a workaround which makes wmwlmon compile again but disables
  wi(4) support
- do correct castings to satisfy higher gcc versions
- added more supported devices to the man page

0.9
===
- ported to FreeBSD, diff by Nathan Lay <nslay@hotmail.com>
- added signal strength support for WaveLAN chipsets, diff by
  Sam Chill <samchill@gmail.com>
- style

0.8
===
- fixed get_first_wnic() which can cause core dumping if wmwlmon is started
  without args because returning (char *) which was already freed, diff by
  Matthieu Herrb <matthieu@openbsd.org>
- added some improvements suggested by mbalmer@openbsd.org;
  use strtonum(3) for scroll options
  define variable size which holds nic name with IF_NAMESIZE
- extended manpage

0.7
===
- added interface auto scan for startup so -i is optional now
- fixed wmwlmon core dumping if nic is gone
- fixed strlcpy(3) issue in wl.c to be sure that the not nul terminated
  network id can't overflow its destination buffer, spotted by
  Marc Balmer <mbalmer@openbsd.org>

0.6
===
- added smooth scrolling for network id
- added special ascii characters, sometimes used for the network id
- extended manpage

0.5
===
- added delay for scroll_bounce()
- seperated nwid scroll refresh from interface poll refresh, diff by
  Claudio Jeker <claudio@openbsd.org>
- fixed a bug in scroll_lcd().  at the end of a string the space was ignored,
  so the scrolling looked a little shaky
- start adding devices to man page from which we know that they work fully
  or partial

0.4
===
- added LCD and Bounce scrolling regulated by the -s option
- increased scrolling speed of the network id
- fixed usage() and manpage.  -i is mandatory not optional
- in signal_handler() replaced exit(3) by a volatile sig_atomic_t flag,
  because exit(3) is not signal handler save

0.3
===
- added scrolling of long network ids.  Can be disabled with the -s option
- in get_nwid() limit the length of network ids to IEEE80211_NWID_LEN
- removed default variables from BSD Makefile

0.2
===
- if the speed result is NULL and passed to atoi(3), it cores.  Therefore
  check speed before passing it to atoi(3)

0.1
===
- initial version
