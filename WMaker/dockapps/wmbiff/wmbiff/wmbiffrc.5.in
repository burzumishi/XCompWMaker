.TH WMBIFFRC 5 "November 11, 2002" "wmbiff"

.SH NAME
wmbiffrc \- configuration file for
.BR wmbiff (1)

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWMbiff\fP is a mail notification tool for the WindowMaker and AfterStep
window managers. It can handle up to 5 mailboxes, more when run using other
window managers. You can define actions
on mouse clicks for the different mailboxes. This manpage explains the
different options which can be specified in a user's wmbiffrc.

.SH OPTIONS
Each option takes the form
.IR option[.mbox] " = " value .
Comments must be preceded by pound signs (#).

The supported configuration options are:

.TP 3
\fBcertfile\fP
File that holds TLS (SSL) certificates.  If specified,
wmbiff will check certificates and exit on a failure, so
your password is secure.  If not present, wmbiff will trust
all certificates and may be vulnerable to a
man-in-the-middle attack.  WMbiff's will not prompt if you
want to accept new certificates.  Instead, wmbiff expects
your mail client to keep certificates in a file.  For
example, if mutt is your mailreader, you may add:

.RS
certfile=/home/<me>/.muttsslcerts
.RE
.TP
\fBtls\fP
Specify cipher suite preferences on a TLS session. Can be a
predefined value from gnults or a custom value. Default value
is: \fINORMAL\fP.

.RE
.TP
\fBinterval\fP
Global interval between mailbox checking. Value is the number of seconds, 5
is the default.
.TP
\fBaskpass\fP
Program run to ask for IMAP passwords, if left empty in the configuration file.
The default is @DEFAULT_ASKPASS@.  Can be specified on a per-mailbox basis.
.TP
\fBskinfile\fP
XPM pixmap file to load for the background.  If not a full
path, wmbiff will search @SKINDIR@, /usr/share/wmbiff,
/usr/local/share/wmbiff, and the current directory for the
pixmap file.
.TP
\fBglobalnotify\fP
Command to be executed when new mail is received in any mailbox. Set
notify.n to override this option for mailbox n.
.TP
\fBlabel.n\fP
Specifies the displayed label for a mailbox. It can be up to five characters
long.
.TP
\fBpath.n\fP
Path to the mailbox, local or remote one. Path lines start with a prefix,
which specifies the type of wmbiff box you're setting up. The following types
are supported:
.RS
.TP
.I mbox
This is a local mbox mailbox. After the prefix, you only need to put the
path to the mailbox wmbiff needs to read.
Local mboxes may be specified using shell commands enclosed
in back-ticks. (`s.)
.\"This is also the default.

.I maildir
This works just like \fImbox\fP above.
.RS
maildir:[:\fIflags\fP:]/path/to/mail/bugtraq/
.TP
\fIflags\fP can one or more of:
.TP
.I F
Flush directory caches by creating (then deleting) a temporary file
in each maildir prior to checking.  This hack speeds up checking
network-mounted maildirs in cases where directory caching can cause
unwanted delays (eg. SFS-mounted maildirs).
.RE
.TP
.I pop3
Using this type, WMBiff will check for mail on a pop3 server using the
specified username, password, host and an optional port number (defaulting
to 110).  If your password contains a special character, eg. '@' or ':',
use the second path format.  See Authentication below for a description of
the auth field.
.RS
pop3:user:passwd@server[:port] [auth]
.RE
.RS
pop3:user passwd server[ port] [auth]
.RE
.TP
.I pop3s
Exactly like pop3, only uses TLS (SSL) when built with gnutls and defaults
to port 995. @GNUTLS_MAN_STATUS@
.TP
.I imap
These are IMAP4 boxes. As with pop3, WMBiff will report the
status of an IMAP4 mbox using the given values. This type
accepts user, optional password, host and optional path to
mailbox and port number.  See Authentication below for a
description of the auth field.  The password may be left
empty: see askpass above for information on password
prompting.  If your password includes a @, use the
space delimited form.  If it contains a space or #, use the
askpass option instead.  The mailbox field may be quoted,
e.g., server/"Mail/Eggs and Spam".  Mailboxes in subfolders
may be described as /INBOX.subfolder by some servers and
/Mail/subfolder by others.

.I imaps
These are IMAP4 boxes wrapped in a TLS (SSL)
connection. @GNUTLS_MAN_STATUS@ Parameters are the same as
those for ordinary IMAP4 boxes.  Port defaults to 993. If
143 is specified, WMBiff will attempt to connect unencrypted
but negotiate TLS using IMAP's STARTTLS command.  TLS
support uses GNUTLS, which is under development and may be
insecure.  See the imap format above
for additional detail about specifying your password.

.TP
.I shell
With this keyword, wmbiff will launch the
specified shell command and read its output (STDOUT)
expecting an integer message count or a three-character
string.  If "new" is in the first line, the string or number
will be displayed in yellow. The behavior of this
experimental keyword is likely to change in future
revisions.
.RS

shell:::lpq | grep Queue | awk '{print $2}'

.RE
.TP
\fBnotify.n\fP
Command to be executed on new mail arrival in the given mailbox. Accepts
the special keyword "beep" to use the pc speaker.
.TP
\fBaction.n\fP
Command to be executed on left mouse click on a mailbox label.
Accepts
the special keyword "msglst" to pop up a window of recent message headers
from IMAP or POP3 mailboxes when the left mouse button is held.
.TP
\fBbuttontwo.n\fP
Command to be executed on middle mouse click on a mailbox level.
Accepts
the special keyword "msglst" to pop up a window of
recent message headers from IMAP or POP3 mailboxes when the middle mouse button is held.
.TP
\fBinterval.n\fP
Per mailbox check interval. Value is the amount of seconds between
checkings, default is the global interval.
.TP
\fBfetchinterval.n\fP
Interval between mail auto-fetching. Values accept 0 to disable, \-1 for
autofetching on new mail arrival, and positive values for a given interval
in seconds.
.TP
\fBfetchcmd.n\fP
Command to be executed to fetch mail. If not specified, fetching through
wmbiff is disabled completely.
Accepts
the special keyword "msglst" to pop up a window of recent message headers
from IMAP and POP3 mailboxes when the right mouse button is held down,
though not when fetchinterval is nonzero.
.TP
\fBdebug.n\fP
Show debugging messages from this mailbox.  Currently
supported values are "all" and "none".  The \-debug option
to wmbiff overrides this setting.  Since IMAP uses a single
connection per server, per-mailbox debugging may not

.SH SIZING

WMBiff will automatically size its window to the number of
configured mailboxes.  While WindowMaker's Dock and
AfterStep's Wharf expect square, 64x64 applets, other window
managers, such as Blackbox or Openbox do not have this
limitation.  This uncharacteristic "dockapp" behavior is
intended to help those users who don't have exactly five
mailboxes to watch.

To preserve the old-style five-mailbox window even when you
have only two, add
.IR path.4=<space><space>
to configure a blank 5th mailbox.

To use the new-style sizing, just configure as many
mailboxes as you want.

.SH AUTHENTICATION

Authentication methods include "cram-md5", "apop" (for
Pop3), and "plaintext".  "cram-md5" and "apop" are only
available when wmbiff is compiled with libgcrypt.
@GCRYPT_MAN_STATUS@
Authentication methods are tried in the following order:
cram-md5, apop, plaintext.

Each authentication method will be tried unless a list is
included in the [auth] field.  For example, append "cram-md5
apop" if you don't want your password to be sent in
cleartext over the network.  Conversely, append "plaintext"
if you don't want wmbiff to bother with other authentication
methods.  Leaving authentication methods unspecified should
be reasonably safe.  The order of entries in the [auth] list
is not currently considered.

.SH TROUBLESHOOTING

For problems authenticating to servers, try specifying the
authentication method explicitly as described above:
sometimes a failed attempt to authenticate can cause later
failures.  Some servers claim to support cram-md5 but fail:
telling wmbiff not to try can help.

For other problems, run wmbiff with the \-debug option.  See
wmbiff(1) for details.

While editing .wmbiffrc, you may find it useful to restart
wmbiff using either control-shift mouse button 1, or killall
\-USR1 wmbiff.
