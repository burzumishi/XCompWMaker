.SH NAME
WMBiff \- A dockable Mailbox Monitor

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wmbiff
[\-display <display name>] [\-geometry +XPOS+YPOS] [\-c <filename>] [\-h] [\-v] [\-debug] [\-fg <foreground-color>] [\-bg <background-color>] [\-hi <highlight-color>] [\-font <X11 font>|default] [\-o] [+w]

.SH DESCRIPTION
WMbiff displays the status of up to five mailboxes. It shows the number
of new mail messages, if any, otherwise 0. In classic mode instead of 0
it shows the total number of messages.
It also has mail
retrieval capabilies, and can be configured to do this automatically. At the
moment, UNIX-style, maildir, POP3, APOP and IMAP4 mailboxes are supported.

The mailboxes are displayed in 5 different lines, each one with its own
description of up to five chars. If no mail is present in a given mailbox,
WMbiff will display the total number of mails in cyan. If there's new mail
in the box, the number of new messages will be displayed in yellow. When new
mail arrives, this number will optionally flash for a small period of time,
and also optionally, a command can be executed on mail arrival (for example,
opening your mail reader or playing a sound file).

Pressing mouse button 1 will execute a command, defined in the user's config
file. Mouse button 3 will execute a command to fetch mail, if defined.
To restart wmbiff, press mouse button 1 while holding control and shift keys,
or send it SIGUSR1.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-v
Show version of program.
.TP
.B \-display <display name>
Use an alternate X Display.
.TP
.B \-geometry <geometry>
Initial window position.
.TP
.B \-c <filename>
Use specified configuration file instead of ~/.wmbiffrc.
.TP
.B \-debug
Print verbose log of progress.
.TP
.B \-fg <color>
Use specified X11 color for foreground. Implies \-font default,
unless overridden.
.TP
.B \-bg <color>
Use specified X11 color for background. Implies \-font default,
unless overridden.
.TP
.B \-hi <color>
Use specified X11 color for new mail counters. Implies \-font
default, unless overridden.
.TP
.B \-font <font>
Use specified X11 font instead of the LED pixmap.  This may
be more readable or suitable for some non-US characters.
The special font "default" tells wmbiff to use a compile
time default.
.TP
.B \-skip-certificate-check
When using TLS (IMAPS), keep going, even if the server's
certificate is invalid.  Invalid certificates have expired,
have a different hostname than you connected to, are
corrupt, or have been revoked.  Do not use this option
unless wmbiff fails and suggests it to you, and even then,
be careful and consider alerting your mail system
administrator first.  The need to use this option is a sign
of server misconfiguration.
.TP
.B \-o
Enable classical mode look and behaviour: shows the number of
new mail messages, if any, or the total number of messages.
This option also enables the special keyword "beep" (disabled
by default).
.TP
.B \+w
Do not use the "withdrawn" state: the wmbiff window will not
be captured as an icon and placed in the dock, but will
instead have its own window.  This option starts with a '+'
for consistency with other software programs: many use '\-w'
to mean the opposite.
