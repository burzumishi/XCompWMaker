But why?:
   That's a question I've asked myself a few times, to be honest.  The idea
   just hit me one day, helped along by a friend of mine who has a Mac that
   has eyes in its menubar.  Between that, and my interest in doing a dock app
   for WindowMaker, this was the result.  I expect any other dock apps I do to
   have somewhat more functionality.

How to build:
   xmkmf
   make
   make install (or just 'cp wmaker /usr/local/bin' if you prefer it there)

Comments:
   Well, not much to say about this, to be honest.  It's not exactly a
   complicated program; in fact, once it's running, there's nothing more you
   can do with it except watch it.

   The 'time' parameter on the command line affects both the update time of
   the pupil moving around, and the time it takes for the eyelids to open or
   close.  These two can't be separated.

   The standard method of starting it up under WindowMaker is 'wmeyes -w -s &'.

   Thanks to whoever 'rws' was at the old X Consortium, the crazy fellow who
      wrote the original xeyes that was my inspiration.
   Thanks to 'shawkie' (shawkie@geocities.com) and of course Rob Malda
      (malda@slashdot.org) for their numerous examples of how to write a
      WindowMaker dock app.
   Thanks to Masayuki Koba, the author of xneko, for the demonstration of how
      to do a mouse-follower without descending into the chaos that is Xt
      intrinsics like xeyes does.
