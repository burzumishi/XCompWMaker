* This is a complete dockapp mixer utilizing the OSS mixer API
* Has a nice On-Screen-Display to visualize current volume levels
* Can adjust main volume, balance, recording status, and mute/unmute channels
* Supports mousewheel to adjust the volume settings
* Supports user specified signals to adjust the volume remotely
* User configuration file can be used to set options

How to use it:

.---------------------------.
| Message Area Message Area | <- (1)
| [ Rec ]  [ ST ]  [ Mute ] | <- (2) (3) (4)
| <- ->             xxx     | <- (5) (6) (7)
| L        R        ___     |
| |  |||   |       /the\    |
| |--|||---|      |K NOB|   | <- (8) (9)
|    ||| <- slider \___/    |
`---------------------------'

1) Current channel name is displayed in this area. If scrolling messages are
   enabled in config, the text will scroll every 30 seconds or so, using long
   sound channel names. If scrolling is disabled, short 5-character channel
   names are used instead, and the message constantly stays on the screen. In
   scroll mode, clicking in this area will re-scroll current message.

2) Clicking REC will toggle record status for current channel, if the channel
   is capable of recording. Some sound cards will allow you to set multiple
   record sources. Some don't, so you can only have one selected at any time.
   If you click here and nothing happens, the channel is not record-capable.

3) ST indicator is lit if the current channel is stereo.

4) Clicking MUTE will mute the current channel. Old volume settings are
   remembered, so clicking it again will un-mute. Also see the knob section
   because there is more than one way to do it :)

5) Clicking <- will switch to previous channel

6) Clicking -> will switch to next channel

7) Numeric indicator of current volume from 0 to 100 percent. Doesn't change
   when the channel is muted, so you can still adjust the volume and then
   unmute.

8) If ST light is on (Stereo channel), you can move this slider left and
   right to set balance. Click on the slider, and drag the mouse left or
   right to adjust. Double-clicking on the slider will center the balance.
   If you are on a mono channel, the slider doesn't move or do anything.

9) Ah, yes, the knob. One of the biggest visual differences since version
   2.x of WMix is that the knob now rendered in real-time opposed to switching
   pixmaps with various knob angles. Bow down to Daniel Richard G. for coming
   up with this awesome routine. Also utilizes new "cursor-hiding-and-moving"
   code which first appeared in volume.app by the same guy. Now you don't
   have to scroll the mouse off your desk to adjust the volume. Anyway, simply
   click on the knob and drag the mouse up or down to adjust the volume.
   After you release the button, your mouse cursor is right back where you
   started. Very Nifty! You can also double-click on the knob to mute the
   current channel. Red LED will turn off... Channel is muted!

Most people have mice with wheels these days, to this support is enabled by
default. Scrolling the mouse wheel up or down will adjust the volume by 3%
up or down. Buttons and step size are configurable from the config file -
see below.

You can also check out ~/.wmix.pid, and use SIGUSR1/2 to adjust the volume
up or down by the configured step size.

The config file:

1 = yes, 0 = no

mousewheel=1			# use mousewheel?
scrolltext=1			# scroll the system messages?
osd=1				# display OSD?
osdcolor=green			# color of the OSD (from rgb.txt)
wheelbtn1=4			# which mousewheel button is "up"
wheelbtn2=5			# which mousewheel button is "down"
wheelstep=3			# the step for mousewheel adjustment

Most defaults are good for normal use, and if there is no config file,
the settings you see above are used. If you want to hack on a config file,
copy sample.wmixrc to ~/.wmixrc and change it around. You can find
complete description of the format in than man page.
