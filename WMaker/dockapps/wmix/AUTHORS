Daniel Richard G. [skunk@mit.edu]
author of volume.app, where I got the knob math and mixer routines from
(which was in turn based on mixer routines in wmix 2.x)

/* the people below have contributed code in the past, though most of the
   code has been rewritten in 3.0 */

gilles querret [gilles.querret@free.fr]
author of the mousewheel patch for wmix

Travis Whitton [travis@atlantic.net]
submitted a patch to restore volume and balance when pressing mute button,
and also did changes in the Makefile to make sure it works on systems other
than my own.

Vinnie Yesue [vinnie@fizz.sonicity.com]
Did the work on changing mixermax stuff, because he had one of those broken
soundcards that made things break (see BUGS)
