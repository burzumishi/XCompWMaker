/* WMVolume mixer interface
 *
 * Some notes:
 *
 * - The volume argument is a floating-point value between 0 (no sound) and
 *   1 (full sound) inclusively.
 *
 * - The balance argument is a floating-point value betwen -1 (full left)
 *   and 1 (full right) inclusively. A value of 0 indicates centered sound.
 *   If the device does not natively support a balance parameter, use the
 *   lr_to_vb() and vb_to_lr() functions in misc.c.
 *
 * - The volume and balance arguments passed to these functions, given that
 *   they are (usually 32-bit) floating-point values, may be capable of
 *   specifying the audio parameters at a finer resolution than the
 *   hardware itself. However, the mixer driver must not quantize the
 *   volume and balance levels returned by the mixer_get_*() routines.
 *
 *   Example: Suppose the mixer device supports specifying the volume as an
 *   integer in the range of 0 to 100. If mixer_set_volume() is called with
 *   an argument of 0.7351, then the device will be set to a volume of 74,
 *   yet subsequent calls to mixer_get_volume() (assuming mixer state has
 *   not changed since) will return 0.7351. Only if the mixer state is
 *   changed by another program (that, say, sets the volume to 51) is the
 *   value returned by this interface quantized (in such a case returning
 *   0.51).
 *
 *   The reason why this quantization must be avoided whenever possible is
 *   that otherwise, a large number of minuscule increases to the volume
 *   level will have no cumulative effect. Calling mixer_set_volume_rel()
 *   ten thousand times with an argument of 0.0001 should successfully
 *   increase the volume to its maximum, even if the device actually
 *   supports only 64 discrete volume levels.
 *
 * - Muting must occur independently of the volume level.
