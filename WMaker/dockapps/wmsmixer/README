You probably want to read the README.wmmixer file too. Most of that
applies to this program, apart from the recsrc code which has been
removed.

The main changes between this and wmmixer are:

* Added scrollwheel support. If your scrollwheel is mapped to buttons
  4 and 5, using it will increase/decrease the volume of the current
  channel.

* Removed all the recsrc code.

* Changed the display arrangement slightly, and replaced the recsrc
  button with a numeric/text display.

* Added the setname configuration option, which allows you to give a
  different channel name (4 chars max) to the built in one if you
  wish.

* Clicking on the channel icon will briefly display the text name for the
  channel. This is also displayed when you switch channels.

* Mono channels have one wide bar rather than two thinner ones.

* Changed some icons, and added a few new ones. Several icons are
  still to be created. Any submissions are always welcome.


Please report any bugs to me <psiren@hibernaculum.net>, rather
than Sam Hawker. I'm sure he doesn't want to go fixing my cockups ;-)
