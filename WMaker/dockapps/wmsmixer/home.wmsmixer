#    Ths channel added becomes the current channel for subsequent
#    setmono, setleft, setright and setname commands.

# setchannel %i
#    Similar to addchannel, except the channel is not actually added
#    to the sequence, merely made the current channel for subsequent
#    setmono, setleft, setright and setname commands.

# setmono %i
#    Sets both left and right volumes for the current channel.
#    The channel may be mono or stereo.
#    The value specified must be an integer in the range 0 to 100.

# setleft %i
#    Sets left volume for the current channel.
#    Do not use on a mono channel.
#    The value specified must be an integer in the range 0 to 100.

# setright %i
#    Sets right volume for the current channel.
#    Do not use on a mono channel.
#    The value specified must be an integer in the range 0 to 100.

# setname <text>
#    Set the name for this channel. This will be displayed briefly
#    when you switch to this channel, or when you click on the
#    icon. The program will only use the first 4 characters of this
#    text.

# At least one channel must be added!
