There are 3 modes of operation on this applications.
You can cycle through the 3 modes by clicking on the right most button <3> repeatedly.
The 3 modes are described below:

	On mode
	---------
	Clicking on the rightmost button <3> for the first time (after the start of 	WMTV) would turn TV on. During this mode, the left <1> and right <2> buttons 	are used to change preset channels which has been defined in your config 		file. Left button to move down 1 channel and Right button to move up one
	channel.

	Tune mode
	---------
	Clicking again on button <3> after On mode would bring WMTV into tune mode. 	During this mode, the left <1> and right <2> buttons have two purposes
	individually. Left clicking on the left <1> or right <2> buttons would
	perform scans of channels. Scanning will stop when there is a strong signal 	strength. Right clicking on the left <1> or right <2> button would fine
	tune the current frequency. After tuning, clicking on button <3> would 	set the fine tuned offset into your config file and bring you back into "On mode".

	Off mode
	--------
	Holding down button <3> for about 3 seconds from any of the two modes
	described above, would turn the TV off.

Right clicking once on the TV Screen would mute/unmute the audio.

Double clicking LEFT mouse button on the TV Screen would launch your favorite TV application when specified with --exe <filename> option in the command line.
If the external application is not set, It'll automatically switch to the build in full screen mode.
Double clicking the MIDDLE mouse button on the TV Screen would bring you into the built in full screen mode.

To launch an external application:

foo@bar > wmtv --exe /usr/X11R6/bin/xawtv		# example.
or
foo@bar > wmtv -e /usr/X11R6/bin/xawtv
