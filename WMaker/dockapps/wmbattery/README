wmbattery displays the status of your laptop's battery in a small icon. This
includes if it is plugged in, if the battery is charging, how many minutes
of battery life remain, battery life remaining (with both a percentage and a
graph), and battery status (high - green, low - yellow, or critical - red).

wmbattery is based on wmapm by Chris D. Faulhaber <jedgar@speck.ml.org>
-- see the copyright file for more information.

wmapm is a nice program - why have I modified it into wmbattery? Here are
some improvements in wmbattery:

  - Improved icon layout. I crammed the same information into less space
    while making the icon more elegant and visually pleasing (IMHO).
  - Easier to drag onto dock.
  - It consumes a little less memory.
  - Uses only 10 colors.
  - You can run in on a different display via -d (broken in wmapm).
  - Support for getting battery status from the sonypi driver instead of APM,
    for some Sony laptops that do not have apm support.
  - ACPI support, including multiple battery support and battery charging
    completion countdown timer.
  - HAL support.
  - upower support.
  - Can make its own estimatess of time remaining or time until full
    charge, even if APM does not.

Conversely, here are some reasons to stick with wmapm:

  - You like its look.
  - It has a neat rainbow-colored progress bar.
  - It has buttons to suspend the laptop and stuff.
  - It may be more actively and/or better maintained. Or not.
    Decide for yourself.

Still, forking is evil, and if I was doing this all over again, I suppose
I'd try to add theme support to wmamn so it could morph into wmbattery with
a theme. Oh well.
