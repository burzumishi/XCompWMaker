wmwifi-0.6 for Debian
---------------------

  Tested with ndiswrapper/2.6.14 x86_64 && i386

wmwifi-0.5 for Debian
---------------------

 This release of wmwifi has been tested using the linux-wlan-ng drivers, the standard
 orinoco_cs shipped with the kernel, ndiswrapper, and the prism54 drivers.

 The ndiswrapper and prism54 drivers do not report thier stat's correctly to the
 wireless extensions in the kernel, so wmwifi cannot reply them correctly.

 This program was tested with kernel 2.4.18,2.4.22,2.4.23, 2.6.3, 2.6.7, and 2.6.8.1
 but should work with any 2.4.X or 2.6.X kernel, or backport wich supports
 Wireless Extentions.
