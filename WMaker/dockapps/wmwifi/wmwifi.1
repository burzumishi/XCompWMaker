.SH NAME
wmwifi \- A dockapp to monitor wireless signal strength.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wmwifi [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B wmwifi
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBWMWiFi\fP is a dockapp that is supported by X window managers such as
Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment. It monitors all
wireless network interfaces on your machine.

The main screen displays the link (signal) strength between the currently
selected card and your wireless access point as a percentage, and has an
LCD look-alike user interface.

The second screen diplays extended stats, which are:
the current rate/speed in megabits, the noise (in dBm), the level (in dBm),
and the actual link amount.

Both screens toggle the interface name and the current associated access
point at the top every 5 seconds.

The back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse
button over the application.

Mouse1 activates/deactivates the scrolling of the Wireless Interface Name / ESSID.

Mouse2 switches the current wireless network interface.

Mouse3 switches between standard and extended modes.
