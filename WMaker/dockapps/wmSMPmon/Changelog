3.2

- Added Solaris support.
- Added CPU load aggreggation so that they fit into two columns.
- A bit of code clean-up to speed up things.

3.1

- Fixed bug where wmSMPmon would crash if no swap is enabled/present
  on the system (thanks to John Schmerge for finding this!)
- Added INSTALL file (thanks to Paul Johnson for reminding me)


3.0

- Improved processing of command line options - unknown options and
  missing parameters are now dealt with
- wmSMPmon now properly supports single CPU machines! On a single CPU
  machine, the CPU load bar is drawn wider and only one graph style is
  supported.
- man page improved and edited Makefile so man page will get installed as well


2.9.2

- Separated OS dependent code from rest of program to improve portability


2.9.1

- Adapted wmSMPmon to kernel 2.6, using code from top and
  procps. kernels 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6 are now supported.
