Installation of wmSMPmon is very simple:

- cd wmSMPmon
- The default location wmSMPmon gets installed in is /usr/local/bin
  (executable) and /usr/local/share/man (man page). If you'd like to
  change that, you need to edit "Makefile" - both paths are defined
  right at the top. The should be no need to change anything else.
- Run "make" followed by "make install". This will build and install
  wmSMPmon.

That's all! :-)
