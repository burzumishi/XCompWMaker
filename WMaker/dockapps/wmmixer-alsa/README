wmmixer-alsa 0.6 by Martin Dahl <dahlm@vf.telia.no>

A hacked version of wmmixer by Sam Hawker to make it use ALSA
(Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) in stead of the OSS sound
drivers in the linux kernel. To compile and run this program,
you will need to get alsa-driver and alsa-lib from
www.alsa-project.org !

To compile the program, just do a 'make', and then copy the
'wmmixer-alsa' program to your favourite location.

See COPYING for licence details.
