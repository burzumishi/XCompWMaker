COMPILATION
===========

You will need the following libraries (with proper headers) installed
in order to compile this app. If you're using Debian, try packages like
the ones indicated.
  libwraster  libwraster2, libwraster2-dev
  libpcre     libpcre3, libpcre3-dev
  libm        libc6, libc6-dev
  libXpm      xlibs, xlibs-dev
  libX11      xlibs, xlibs-dev
  libcurl     libcurl4, libcurl4-dev

For the most part, you should just have to do "./configure && make install"
and the thing will build everything and install it.

The only really interesting compile-time parameters would be the P and X
variables in animation.c, if you don't like the 10-second cycle or
something.

If you get errors about a missing libwraster, check the following:
 1) Do you have both the library AND the header installed? If the command
    "locate wraster.h" doesn't come back with a header file in one of the
    normal places, you'll have trouble.
 2) Check for a line like the following in your ./configure output:
     checking if libwraster is wanted... yes: libraries /usr/lib  includes /usr/include
    In this case, we will look for the files /usr/lib/libwraster.so and
    /usr/include/wraster.h. If for some reason you have these files in a
    place other than ./configure looks for them, use the --with-libwraster
    option to specify the proper prefix. If you have something really dumb
    like /usr/include/wraster.h and /usr/X11R6/lib/libwraster.so, try adding
    specific -I and -L options to your CFLAGS variable.

If you get errors about a missing pcre.h, and you have your header in
/usr/include/pcre/pcre.h instead of /usr/include/pcre.h, you will have to
add "-I/usr/include/pcre" to your CFLAGS variable when running ./configure.

If you get an error about anything missing in the b0rken subdirectory, the
problem is most likely that some library function or another is broken on
your system, configure detected this fact, a replacement was requested, and
no replacement is available. You are welcome to submit a patch.

For run-time hints, please see the HINTS file.
