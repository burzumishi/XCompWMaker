wmweather+ (2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove curl handle from the multihandle before closing the file
    descriptor and before doing the callbacks. Otherwise we might get another
    completion message, which will cause double-free errors and such.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Tue, 17 Aug 2010 15:27:37 -0400

wmweather+ (2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply 01_wmweather+_patch_displaydelay.dpatch from Debian
  * Fix Debian bug #419644 in a different way: First, change snprintf and
    vsnprintf handling to be more like AC_FUNC_MALLOC handles malloc. Second,
    just always call FUNC_VSNPRINTF_LIBOBJ instead of being conditional on
    snprintf.

wmweather+ (2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove libwww, add libcurl.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Sun, 06 Jan 2008 22:42:07 -0500

wmweather+ (2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for the new FW/SC distinction in some of the forecast data.
    Also do it for METAR, even though the two are supposedly the same there.
  * Fix some nasty double-free bugs in download.c if terminate_handler were to
    be called before HTLoadAbsolute/HTPostAbsolute returned.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Mon, 17 May 2004 23:55:48 -0400

wmweather+ (2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * The downloader now tracks active downloads, and refuses to start a second
    download when one is already active for a particular target file. Also,
    downloads now time out after 10 minutes.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Mon, 29 Mar 2004 22:22:31 -0500

wmweather+ (2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops, forgot to fix the manpage when the URIs changed in v2.5.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Fri, 21 Nov 2003 20:55:07 -0500

wmweather+ (2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use atexit() to clean up downloaded files.
  * Alter forecast parsers to be less picky. 'AVN' and 'MRF' are changing to
    'GFS' and 'GFSX' on Dec 16, and looking for just "MOS GUIDANCE" instead of
    "xxx MOS GUIDANCE" should work about as well.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Fri, 21 Nov 2003 20:55:07 -0500

wmweather+ (2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the "-display-mode" option. This fixes part of Debian bug #200110.
  * Tack the PID on to downloaded files, so multiple instances of wmweather+
    won't stomp on each other. This fixes the rest of Debian bug #200110
  * Rewrote the longitude-guessing code, now it just depends on time_t being
    an arithmetic type (which mkgmtime() did already).
  * Replace the old b0rken/mktime.c with the one from GNU tar. The old one has
    a SysVism that wasn't working too well for BSD people, who need the
    replacement because mktime() on BSD fails for 'impossible' times (i.e. the
    hour skipped when DST begins).
  * Change forecast URIs, because NOAA changed them.
  * Add a 'forget-warning-zones' option, which IMO adequately covers Debian
    bug #214482. And it allows you to override zones on the command line too.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Tue, 28 Oct 2003 13:35:24 -0500

wmweather+ (2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove a bunch of unused variables.
  * Initialize a few things the compiler can't tell will always be initialized
    before they're used.
    - dock.c update_dock(): i will be initialized if either j&1 or j&2, and
      only used if j&3. j is not volatile, so this will always initialize i.
    - forecast.c locate_current(): current is set to NULL at the beginning of
      the function. curdiff is set whenever current is, and is only used when
      current!=NULL.
  * Added .nf commands to the manpage, so man won't complain about long
    pseudo-URLs (Fixes Debian bug #184306).
  * Fixed various assumptions about char signedness (i.e. I made them
    explicitly signed char) (Fixes Debian bug #181245).
  * Added multiple warning zones, so for example you can look at both kyz036
    and kyc209 for warnings (Partially fixes Debian bug #185651).
    - The summary isn't so much a warning summary, as a summary of the weather
      over the past day or so.
    - Unless those "warnings not in the expected place" were due to the kyc209
      versus kyz036 issue, I can't determine where the files might actually
      have been. Sorry.
  * Updated some of the docs.
  * autoconf changed the name of the malloc cache variable...
  * Added a replacement mktime. Hopefully it works right.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Sat, 22 Mar 2003 12:45:10 -0500

wmweather+ (2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a compiler warning, thanks to Martin Godisch
  * Remove the debian directory at the request of the Debian maintainer; if
    you want those files, they are available at debian.org
  * Removed documentation of useless -geometry option
  * Fixed crash on right-click when no warning zone was given

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Tue, 28 Jan 2003 12:47:07 -0500

wmweather+ (2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * It seems I forgot to create a b0rken/malloc.c

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Tue,  1 Oct 2002 16:36:12 -0400

wmweather+ (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the 'malformed location' error message more clear.
  * Fix stupid crash in forecast.c (didn't wrap properly when iterating over
    an array)
  * Fix is_forecast_current, mktime wants 0-based month.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Mon, 30 Sep 2002 15:02:29 -0400

wmweather+ (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * In no particular order:
  * Animations can now display a label indicating the percent being shown. The
    forecast window uses this extensively.
  * All URIs can now be changed via command line/config file options.
  * Added ./configure checks for b0rken snprintf/vsnprintf.
  * Added ETA forecasts. These are mixed in with the AVN forecasts in the
    rotation, sorted by time.
  * Added display of the forecast type, which shows up at the bottom of the
    forecast window where wind chill, heat index, and so on appear.
  * When not animating, the percent chance cutoff can be adjusted using the
    mouse wheel (as mapped to buttons 4 and 5).
  * Made all forecast and warning options optional. Thus, if you don't specify
    e.g. avn-station, no AVN forecasts will be downloaded.
  * Regularized options: -radar is now -radar-uri, and -zone is now
    -warning-zone.
  * Support for POST for the radar image.
  * Support for system-wide configs.
  * -email is now optional too.
  * Lots of code cleanups.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Sun, 22 Sep 2002 14:25:58 -0400

wmweather+ (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a few URIs.
  * Fix rounding errors in the pressure conversion functions (returned floats
    don't need to be rounded, damnit!)
  * Fix a bug in the warning code (displaying the wrong warnings)

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Sun, 15 Sep 2002 18:35:18 -0400

wmweather+ (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle libwww fds going bad, so the select will still function.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Sun,  8 Sep 2002 11:22:05 -0400

wmweather+ (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove dependancy on libftp, we use libwww's FTP module now.
  * Rewrote the file downloader to take advantage of libwww's callbacks
    (instead of waiting for the file to appear).
  * Adjusted the m4 files to be more informative, and to check for libwraster
    in /usr/X11R6 (stupid place for it, but oh well).
  * Add some international METAR support. Mainly things reported in different
    units.
  * Make dock.c signals safe!

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Thu,  5 Sep 2002 22:01:42 -0400

wmweather+ (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added failure conditions to configure.ac.
  * Actually use LIBOBJS. Change to automake-1.6 since 1.4 is b0rken.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Sun,  1 Sep 2002 20:31:55 -0400

wmweather+ (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debianization
  * Autoconfiscated
  * Updated wmgeneral from wmpasman
  * Fixed a bug in createXBMfromXPM
  * Use createXBMfromXPM to get the mask. It's easier.

 -- Brad Jorsch <anomie@users.sourceforge.net>  Thu, 15 Aug 2002 15:31:46 -0400

version 1.6

  * Apparently, AVN uses JUNE instead of JUN. Let's guess it uses JULY too
    while we're at it.

 -- Tue, 18 Jun 2002 08:52:27 -0500

version 1.5

  * Fixed heat index so it'll display when the temp is below 100 ;)

 -- Tue, 16 Apr 2002 21:22:07 -0500

version 1.4

  * Changed the METAR display around a little bit. Local time is now primary.
  * Changed the warning output to indicate the file the warning is from.
  * minor code cleanups

 -- Sat,  8 Sep 2001 17:14:32 -0500

version 1.3

  * Display a moon instead of a sun when it's supposed to be night. We even
    calculate a rough moon phase and calculate the solar zenith to determine
    whether the sun is up or not.
  * Adjusted some of the graphics again. master is even smaller now!
  * Make the forecast bottom line change priority every few seconds (in other
    words, if more than one line could be displayed it will alternate between
    them).

 -- Thu,  6 Sep 2001 22:55:10 -0500

version 1.2

  * Fixed SEPT bug

 -- Sat,  1 Sep 2001 21:10:22 -0500

version 1.1

  * Made the master xpm smaller.
  * Changed the font handling so only 1 copy of the characters is needed.
  * Changed some of the wmgeneral stuff more.

 -- Tue, 28 Aug 2001 12:46:54 -0500

version 1.0

  * Wrote the thing over the past few weeks. I probably should have been
    adding changelog entries all along, oh well.

 -- Tue, 21 Aug 2001 18:36:32 -0500
