WMCPULoad - A dockapp to monitor CPU usage

General Information
===================
WMCPULoad is a program to monitor CPU usage. It is a dockapp that is supported
by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and
Enlightenment.

It displays the current usage, expressed as a percentile and a chart, and has an
LCD look-alike user interface. The back-light may be turned on/off by clicking
the mouse button over the application. If the CPU usage hits a certain
threshold, an alarm-mode will alert you by turning back-light on.

It runs on GNU/Linux / FreeBSD / OpenBSD / NetBSD / BSDi / Solaris / Cygwin.

If you want to run wmcpuload as swallowed application inside the GNOME panel,
open 'Create swallow Applet' dialog and enter the values as below.

  1. Title application to swallow: <title name> - specified with '-t' option
  2. Command (optional): wmcpuload -w -t <title name>
  3. width: 62
  4. height: 62

NOTE: You can't run swallowed application with sawfish 1.0.1. This problem has
fixed in current cvs.


For Enlightenment users

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q) Which window managers do support dockapps?
A) - Window Maker  http://www.windowmaker.org/
   - AfterStep     http://www.afterstep.org/
   - Blackbox      http://blackbox.alug.org/
   - Enlightenment http://www.enlightenment.org/
   - Fluxbox       http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/
   - Waimea        http://waimea.sourceforge.net/
   - PWM           http://www.students.tut.fi/~tuomov/pwm/
   - Golem         http://golem.sourceforge.net/

Q) Can I set the initial size?
A) No. As far as I know, there is no dockapp which can be set the size.

Q) (How) Does WMCPULoad support SMP system?
A) WMCPULoad will probably work fine on an SMP system. However, it only displays
   the usage statistics for the all CPUs. I may add the new command line option
   (e.g. '--cpu <number>') to specify the CPU number. but this feature is the
   bottom of my TODO list, since I do not have an SMP system.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   NOTE: WMCPULoad has '-c, --cpu' option since version 0.8.0. but it only works
         on GNU/Linux. (Thanks to Laurent Raufaste for beta test)
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) Why is kamp-idled spending many CPU time on my GNU/Linux box?
A) kapm-idled executes HLT instructions to save power.

   Stephen Rothwell (GNU/Linux APM maintainer) said:
   "kapm-idled may do quite a lot more than just execute HLT instructions
   depending on how smart the BIOS is about saving power.  Unfortunately, some
   BIOSs are pretty dumb and in some cases more power is consumed by having
   CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE defined in your kernel build than by not."
                                              -- from debian-devel mailing lists

   '-p, --ignore-proc' option will help you. (e.g., wmcpuload -p kapm-idled)
