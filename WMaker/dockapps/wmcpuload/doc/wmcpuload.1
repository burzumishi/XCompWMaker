\fBWMCPULoad\fP is a dockapp that is supported by X window managers such as
Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment. It displays the current
CPU usage, expressed as a percentile and a chart, and has an LCD look-alike
user interface. The back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse
button over the application. If the CPU usage hits a certain threshold, an
alarm-mode will alert you by turning on back-light.
