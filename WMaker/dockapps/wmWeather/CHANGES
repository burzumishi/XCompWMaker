wmWeather changes.

Version         Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.31  		- released May 4, 1999.
		  fixed some conversion bugs in wind speed..


1.30  		- released April 13, 1999.
		  Fixed a bug whereby the App would crash when trying to gain input
		  focus under non-WindowMaker WMs (focus is now grabbed by
		  `PointerRoot' not `iconwin').

		  Added StationID and `time-of-last-update' labels. To do this I needed
		  to shrink the fonts down and scrunch them together a bit more.

		  Added new command line option to change their color;
		 		   -tc <color>

		  Added code to properly decode wind speed when in MPS.

		  Fixed bug in beaufort wind speed calcs.


1.29  		- released March 13, 1999.
		  Reorganized wmgeneral.c and renamed it xutils.c (wmgeneral.h
		  -> xutils.h as well ). Also moved it into the same directory as wmWeather.
		  Now, the openXwindow is split into 2 parts. You first need to call
		  initXwindow(argc, argv). This allows us to check the display depth
		  before we commit to a particular pixmap (this will be useful in my
		  other DockApps to dynamically set appropriate pixmaps based on depth).
		  Got rid of alot of the other routines that I never use.

		  Added 4 more command line option to set the colors of the text:

				-bc  <color> for setting the BackGround color.
				-lc  <color> for setting the Label color.
				-dc  <color> for setting the Data color.
				-wgc <color> for setting the Wind Gust color.

		  Also cleaned up the pixmap to minimize the number of colors used.

                  Changed metric toggle to work with a key press (any key).

                  Added double click support. Now double clicking does the following:

                                Double Mouse Left: pops up the fully decoded METAR file
                                                   in xmessage.

                                Double Mouse Middle: Currently undefined.

                                Double Mouse Right: Forces a new update (i.e. download.)




1.28  		- released March 9, 1999.
		  Changed -celsius (-c) option to -metric (-m). Naming makes more
		  sense that way...

		  Added -W option to display WindChill instead of DewPoint.
		  Since Windchill is not always available, we only show it if its
		  available. If its not, we paste up DewPoint as default.

		  Also added -mps option to display wind speed in units of
		  meters/second (when in -metric mode).

1.27  		- released March 8, 1999.
		  fixed bug in speed calculation when wind is gusting.


1.26  		- released February 24, 1999.
		  Added -delay option.

1.25  		- released February 16, 1999.
		  Added Wind speeds on the 'Beaufort scale'
		  Thanks to Paul Martin <pm@zetnet.net> for this addition.

1.24  		- released February 12, 1999.
		  Added --passive-ftp option to wget...

1.23  		- released February 2, 1999.
		  Few more bug fixes...
		  Added support for different Pressure units...

1.22		- released February 1, 1999.
		  Fixed minor bug in direction abbreviations. Added a bit more to man
		  page.

1.21		- released January 29, 1999.
		  Fixed a problem in the perl script. Made the file paths absolute.

1.2		- released January 29, 1999.
		  Added Wind speed line. Ended up decoding the Raw METAR line.
		  Fixed a few bugs...
		  Changed location of files from /tmp to ~/.wmWeatherReports
		  Changed units of pressure and wind speed to mmHg and km/h
		  when Celsius is set. (Really should change the flag to -metric).

1.1		- Released Jan. 25, 1999.
		  Bug fixes.
		  Added Degrees F/C support...
		  Added a bit more info on where to find info on METAR/TAF
