Installation instructions for wmWeather.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wmWeather requires the Xpm library (which should be available on most machines
with XFree86 installed). And it requires that the GNU wget utility be installed
as well. wget is a utility that allows you to grab stuff like html files and
images diretly off the www without using a graphical browser. (Also, you
obviously need to be connected to internet in a way that wget will work.)
You also need to have Perl installed.

On FreeBSD systems you may need to use gmake instead of make.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) gunzip wmWeather-1.29.tar.gz
1) tar -xvf wmWeather-1.29.tar
2) cd wmWeather-1.29/Src/
3) make clean
4) make
5) make install (must be root)
6) wmWeather & (or 'wmWeather -h' for help, or 'man wmWeather' for the man page)
7) You need to set the location of perl correctly in GrabWeather if your perl
   is located in a place other than /usr/bin/
