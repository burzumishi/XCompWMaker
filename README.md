XCompWMaker
===========

Classic Window Maker with Composition effects.

All these packages where modified to work together, choose the ones you want to play arround with:

Choose a composition manager to install: 

### xcompmgr (Xorg)

__xcompmgr__ is a sample compositing manager for X servers supporting the XFIXES, DAMAGE, RENDER, and COMPOSITE extensions.  It enables basic eye-candy effects.

### Compton (xcompmgr fork)

__Compton__ is a compositor for X, and a fork of __xcompmgr-dana__.

I was frustrated by the low amount of standalone lightweight compositors. Compton was forked from Dana Jansens' fork of xcompmgr and refactored.  I fixed whatever bug I found, and added features I wanted. Things seem stable, but don't quote me on it. I will most likely be actively working on this until I get the features I want. This is also a learning experience for me. That is, I'm partially doing this out of a desire to learn Xlib.

### Cairo Composite Manager

__Cairo Composite Manager__ is a versatile and extensible composite manager which use cairo for rendering.
Plugins can be used to add some cool effects to your desktop.


And install latest version of __Window Maker__ (Window Manager):

### Window Maker

__Window Maker__ is the GNU window manager for the X Window System. It was designed to emulate the look and feel of part of the NEXTSTEP(tm) GUI. It's supposed to be relatively fast and small, feature rich, easy to configure and easy to use, with a simple and elegant appearance borrowed from NEXTSTEP(tm).

Window Maker was designed keeping integration with GNUstep in mind and is the "official" window manager for it. It is also part of the GNU project (www.gnu.org) Read more about GNUstep further on this file.

Hints (information given by applications to integrate well with the window manager) for Motif(tm) and NETWM are also supported (NETWM is used by KDE and GNOME, so they are automatically supported as a result).  So you can replace any
of the window managers for these environments with Window Maker while keeping most, if not all, of the native window manager functionality.

Window Maker was previously called WindowMaker.
Window Maker has no connection with Windowmaker, the software for making windows and doors.
