Classic Window Maker with Composition effects.

## Window Maker

Window Maker is the GNU window manager for the X Window System. It was designed to emulate the look and feel of part of the NEXTSTEP(tm) GUI. It's supposed to be relatively fast and small, feature rich, easy to configure and easy to use, with a simple and elegant appearance borrowed from NEXTSTEP(tm).

Window Maker was designed keeping integration with GNUstep in mind and is the "official" window manager for it. It is also part of the GNU project (www.gnu.org) Read more about GNUstep further on this file.

Hints (information given by applications to integrate well with the window manager) for Motif(tm) and NETWM are also supported (NETWM is used by KDE and GNOME, so they are automatically supported as a result).  So you can replace any
of the window managers for these environments with Window Maker while keeping most, if not all, of the native window manager functionality.

Window Maker was previously called WindowMaker.

Window Maker has no connection with Windowmaker, the software for making windows and doors.
